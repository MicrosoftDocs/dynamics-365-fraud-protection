# Manage custom Cosmos DB lists

Custom lists are created and defined by you. You have the ability to create custom lists that utilize Cosmos DB as a data source, tailored to your specific business needs or fraud protection strategy. For instance, you can create a custom list containing email addresses, IP addresses, or product IDs, along with additional values associated with each entry. This option is ideal for large and complex datasets that require real-time updates and access. Moreover, it allows you to maintain all list data in one place within your Cosmos DB database.

## Prerequisites

To create a custom list using Cosmos DB in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you must first [create a container in Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-create-container) and [choose a partition key that's appropriate for your data structure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#choose-partitionkey).

## Use custom lists

[Rules](rules.md) define custom logic that automates business decisions. To help define this logic, you can take advantage of any list in a rule. For example, you can create one list of email addresses that you consider risky and another list of email addresses that you consider safe. You can then configure a rule so that all sign-in attempts that use an email address in the **Risky Emails** list are rejected, whereas sign-in attempts that use an email address in the **Safe Emails** list are approved.

## Single-column and multicolumn lists

The following example shows two separate lists, **Risky Emails** and **Safe Emails**. In both lists, a single column of values represents a key (in this case, the email address).

| Risky Emails |
|--------------|
| `Kayla@contoso.com` |
| `Jamie@bellowscollege.com` |
| `Marie@atatum.com` |

| Safe Emails |
|-------------|
| `Camille@fabrikam.com` |
| `Miguel@proseware.com` |
| `Tyler@contoso.com` |

However, you can use additional columns to hold values that are relevant to the key. For example, instead of using two separate lists, you can combine the same information into one multicolumn list, as shown here.

| Email address | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| `Kayla@contoso.com` | Risky |
| `Jamie@bellowscollege.com` | Risky |
| `Marie@atatum.com` | Risky |
| `Camille@fabrikam.com` | Safe |
| `Miguel@proseware.com` | Safe |
| `Tyler@contoso.com` | Safe |

You can then configure your rule so that all sign-in attempts that use an email address that appears in this list and has a status of *Risky* are rejected, whereas attempts that use an email address that has a status of *Safe* are approved.

In addition to using multicolumn lists to combine safe and block lists, you can use them to specify the unique levels of risk that are associated with a set of products, email addresses, or countries/regions. For example, if specific product types present different levels of risk to your business, you can make decisions for those products differently. Specifically, you can evaluate each product against its own score threshold. To use this approach, you must first create a list that represents this information, as shown in the following example.

| Product type | Score threshold |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Digital | 500 |
| Consumable | 600 |
| Physical | 750 |

You can then configure a rule that enforces the rejection of transactions where the [risk score](ap-scorecard.md#risk-model-score) exceeds the specified threshold for the product type. For information about how to create effective rules to customize your business logic, see [Rules](rules.md).

## Create a custom list

You can define a list and then reference the list in a [rule](rules.md). Before creating the list definition, ensure you have met the prerequisites described in the [Prerequisites](manage-cosmos-db-lists.md#prerequisites) section earlier in this article.

To create a list definition, follow these steps.

1. Select **New list**.
1. Add a name and description that will make it easy for your team to identify and use the list.
1. Select **Cosmos DB** from data source menu.
1. Add **Azure Cosmos DB account**.
1. Add **Database name**.
1. Add **Azure key vault URL** which contains the connection string to the Azure Cosmos DB. The connection string should be stored as a secret in the key vault. An example of such a connection string is: `AccountEndpoint=<EndpointUrl>;AccountKey=<AccessKey>`.
1. You can now add a timeout and select **Test connection** to check your database connection. A list of containers will appear after a successful connection.
1. Choose a container from the dropdown menu. Once you select a container, properties from the first document in the container will be auto-populated as columns.
1. To add more columns, select  **Add column**. You can either select a column from the dropdown menu, if available, or enter a custom one.
1. You can select **Preview** to preview the list data..
1. Select **Create**.

    Because of caching, it might take up to two minutes for the list to become active.

> Don't include the following sensitive personal data or highly regulated data types in the files that you upload:
>
> - Biometric data, genetic data, or any data that is related to health
> - Personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, or religious views
> - Personal data that, by its nature, is sensitive or private, such as data about a person's sexual orientation or philosophical beliefs
>
> For information about how data is used and protected in Fraud Protection, see [Security, compliance, and data subject requests](security-compliance.md).

## Update a custom list

You can update a custom Cosmos DB list from the **Lists** page at any time, to add new information or change existing information. You can change the description of a custom list, but you can't change its name and columns if it's used in a published rule or velocity.

To update a custom Cosmos DB list in Fraud Protection, follow these steps.

1. Select the list you wish to update, and then select **Edit**.
1. Make the desired changes.
1. If any of the mandatory fields in the **Database** section have been changed, you can select **Test connection** before updating.
1. Optionally, you can select **Preview** to view the list data before updating.
1. Select **Update** to apply your changes.

## Delete a custom list

- To delete a list, select the list, and then select **Delete**.
- To delete multiple lists, select the lists you want to remove, and then select **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> Lists which are referenced in rules or velocities cannot be deleted.

## Search for a custom list

When you search for a list, all list names, descriptions, data source type are searched, and the results are filtered accordingly.

- To search for a list, enter a keyword in the **Search** field in the upper right of the **Lists** page.
- To remove the filter, either clear the keyword from the **Search** field or select the **X** to the right.

## Preview a custom list

You can preview a list in Fraud Protection. The preview pane shows a maximum of 20 rows.

- To preview a list, select it, and then select **Preview**.
