# Integrate Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection real-time APIs

To take advantage of the full suite of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection features, send your transaction data to the real-time APIs. In the *Evaluate* experience, this allows you to analyze the results of using Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. In the *Protect* experience, you can also honor decisions based on the rules you have configured.

Depending on how you choose to use Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you may make use of different sets of APIs, as seen below: 

- **Purchase protection APIs**: Purchase, PurchaseStatus, BankEvent, Chargeback, Refund, UpdateAccount, Label
- **Account protection APIs**: SignUp, SignUpStatus, Label

For documentation about all supported events, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2084942" target="_blank">Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection API</a>.


## Get set up

### Sign in
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a Global Administrator in your Microsoft Azure tenant to complete the initial sign-in.

Visit the portal for each environment you intend to use, sign in, and accept the terms and conditions if prompted.
- Sandbox - <a href="https://dfp.microsoft-int.com" target="_blank">https://dfp.microsoft-int.com</a> 
- Production - <a href="https://dfp.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://dfp.microsoft.com</a> (You might already have completed this step in production during initial sign-up.)

### Create Azure Active Directory applications
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be an Application Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Global Administrator in your Azure tenant to complete this step.

To acquire the tokens required to call the APIs, you must use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) applications. You can configure these by applications using the **Real-time APIs** page in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.

#### To configure Azure AD applications:

1. In the left navigation, select **Data**, select **API management**, and then select **Configuration**. 
1. Complete the form to create your app. We recommend creating one Azure AD application for each environment that you operate. 

   The following fields are required: 
    - **Application display name** - Give your application a descriptive name. Maximum length is 93 characters. 
    - **Environment** - Choose whether this application should call your production or integration (sandbox) endpoint. 
    - **Authentication method** - Choose whether you would like to authenticate via certificate or a secret (password). 

1. For the certificate method, select: 
    1. **Choose file** to upload the public key. (The matching private key is required when you acquire tokens.) 
    1. **Secret** to automatically generate a password after the application has been created.

1. When you finish filling in the fields, select **Create application**. 

  The confirmation screen summarizes your app's name, ID, and the certificate thumbprint or secret, depending on your authentication method. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please save your secret or certificate thumbprint information for future reference. The secret will only be displayed once.

#### To create an additional application:

- Select **Create another application**. 

You can create as many apps as necessary to run API calls in each of your environments. 

### Manage existing Azure AD applications 
After you create your Azure AD apps, you can manage them through the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps" target="_blank">Azure portal</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-how-applications-are-added" target="_blank">Azure documentation site</a>. 

### Manually configure Azure AD applications
To set up your applications directly in Azure, see [Create Azure AD apps in Azure Portal or PowerShell](azure-apps-portal-powershell.md).

## Call the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection real-time APIs 
To integrate your systems with Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, complete the following sections.

### Required IDs and information
- **Environment URI** - The URIs for your sandbox or production environment appear on the **Configuration** tab of the **API Management** page in the Fraud Protection portal.
- **Directory (tenant) ID** - The Directory ID is the globally unique identifier (GUID) for a tenant's domain in Azure. It appears in the Azure portal and on the **Configuration tab** of the **API Management** page in the Fraud Protection portal. 
- **Application (client) ID** - This identifies the Azure AD app you've created for calling APIs. Get the ID from the **Real-time APIs** confirmation screen or find it later in the Azure portal under **App registrations**. There will be one ID for each app you created.
- **Certificate thumbprint or secret** - Get the thumbprint or secret from the Real-time APIs confirmation screen.

### Generate an access token
You must generate this token and provide it with each API call. Note that access tokens have a limited lifespan. We recommend that you cache and reuse it until it's time to get a new access token.

The following C# code samples provide examples of acquiring a token with your certificate or secret. Replace the placeholders with your specific information.

**Certificate thumbprint**
```cs
public async Task<string> AcquireTokenWithCertificateAsync()
{
    var x509Cert = CertificateUtility.GetByThumbprint("<Certificate thumbprint>");
    var clientAssertion = new ClientAssertionCertificate("<Client ID>", x509Cert);
    var context = new AuthenticationContext("<Authority URL. Typically https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Directory_ID]>");
    var authenticationResult = await context.AcquireTokenAsync("<API endpoint for INT or PROD>", clientAssertion);

    return authenticationResult.AccessToken;
}
```

**Secret**
```cs
public async Task<string> AcquireTokenWithSecretAsync()
{
    var clientAssertion = new ClientCredential("<Client ID>", "<Client secret>");
    var context = new AuthenticationContext("<Authority URL. Typically https://login.microsoftonline.com/[Directory_ID]>");
    var authenticationResult = await context.AcquireTokenAsync("<API endpoint for INT or PROD>", clientAssertion);

    return authenticationResult.AccessToken;
}
```


Behind the scenes, the code above generates an HTTP request and receives a response similar to the following.

**Response**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: <date>
Content-Length: <content length>

{
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":"3599",
  "ext_expires_in":"3599",
  "expires_on":"<date timestamp>",
  "not_before":"<date timestamp>",
  "resource":"https://api.dfp.dynamics.com",
  "access_token":"<your access token; e.g.: eyJ0eXA...NFLCQ>"
}
```

- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/multitenant-identity/client-assertion" target="_blank">Use client assertion to get access tokens from Azure AD</a>
- <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/multitenant-identity/token-cache" target="_blank">Cache access tokens</a>

### Call the APIs
To call the APIs, follow these steps:

<ol>
 <li> 
    Pass the following required HTTP headers on each request. 
    <table> 
    <tr> 
    <th>Header name</th> 
    <th>Header value</th> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
    <td>Authorization</td> 
    <td>
    Use the following format for this header (replace <i>accesstoken</i> with the actual token value):<br /> 
        <ul><li> Bearer <i>accesstoken</i>, where accesstoken is the token that is returned by Azure AD.</li></ul> 
    </td> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
    <td>x-ms-correlation-id</td> 
    <td>Send a new GUID value on each set of API calls that are made together.</td> 
    </tr> 
    </table> 
    </li> 
   <li>Generate an event-based payload. Fill in the event data with the relevant information from your system. For documentation about all supported events, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2084942">Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection API</a>. 
    </li> 
   <li>Combine the header (which includes the access token) and the payload, and then send them to your Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection endpoint.</li>
</ol>


## View the sample app 
For additional reference, view the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085137" target="_blank">sample merchant app</a> and the accompanying developer documentation. The sample app provides an example of how to call Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection APIs, including API events like sending customer account updates, refunds, and chargebacks in real time. The documentation for the sample app is linked to actual sample code whenever such links are possible. Otherwise, code samples exist directly in the documentation.
