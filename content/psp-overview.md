# Payment service provider enablement (preview)

[!include [preview banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides capabilities that payment service providers (PSPs) can use to help protect their merchants from fraudulent activity.

A single PSP might have hundreds to thousands of merchants that need a fraud protection solution to help protect their business. The merchants might serve numerous industries and verticals, such as retail, gaming, digital goods, and travel. The size, structure, and industries that are served require fraud protection capabilities that are beyond what an individual enterprise customer requires.

Optimized experiences enable PSPs to easily integrate Fraud Protection into their existing infrastructure. They also enable PSPs to combat fraud either on behalf of their merchants or together with their merchants. PSPs can observe and manage fraud with their many merchants across multiple verticals and within merchants that have deep hierarchies.
