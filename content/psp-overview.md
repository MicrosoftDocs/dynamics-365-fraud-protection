# Payment service provider enablement (preview)

[!include [preview banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides payment service providers (PSPs) the capability to protect their merchants from fraudulent activity. 

A single PSP could have hundreds to thousands of merchants who need a fraud protection solution to protect their business. The merchants can be serving numerous industries and verticals, such as retail, gaming, digital goods, and travel. The size, structure, and industries that are served require fraud protection capabilities that are beyond that required by an individual enterprise customer. 

Optimized experiences enable PSPs to easily integrate Fraud Protection into their existing infrastructure and enable them to combat fraud on behalf of their merchants or with their merchants. PSPs will be able to observe and manage fraud with their many merchants across the multiple verticals and within merchants with deep hierarchies.
