# Assessment reporting

[!include[deprecation](includes/deprecation.md)]

Reporting is currently limited to the following three real-time scorecards for assessments created using the [Assessment wizard](assessment-create-new.md#assessment-wizard-overview):

- **Bot score distribution** – This chart shows the event volume, aggregated by bot model score.
- **Rule decision trend** – This chart shows the percentage of decisions that are approved, rejected, challenged, and reviewed by rules.
- **Top rules** – This chart shows the rules that trigger the highest volume of automated decisions.

Apart from _Device fingerprinting_, all other [Assessment templates](assessment-create-new.md#template) support these real-time scorecards.
