# Evaluate proof of concept options

This article explains how to evaluate proof of concept (POC) options in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.

Fraud Protection lets you evaluate a POC to determine whether a proposed fraud solution can meet your business needs. The POC includes a free 90-day Fraud Protection trial that you can assess before you make a purchase decision.

## Prerequisites

- To participate in a Fraud Protection POC, you must have a Microsoft Entra tenant. If you don't already have an Microsoft Entra tenant, you can sign up for one.
- Before you can start a Fraud Protection POC, Microsoft or a Microsoft authorized partner must provide a promotion code to you. If you don't have a promotion code, see [Get started with Fraud Protection](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/get-started/?appname=fraudprotection) to contact a partner and request one.

## Fraud Protection POC capabilities 

The table below outlines the Fraud Protection POC capabilities, including their types, requirements, estimated completion times. There are two types of POC capabilities: Account Protection Online POC and Purchase Protection Online POC. Both types involve integration. 

| Fraud Protection capability | POC type | Requirements | Estimated time for completion |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Account protection](#account-protection-online-poc) | Online POC | API integration | Six to eight weeks |
| [Purchase protection](#purchase-protection-online-poc) | Online POC | API integration | Six to eight weeks |
