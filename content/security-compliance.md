# Compliance overview for Fraud Protection

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind and is only intended to be used to prevent fraud and help identify legitimate payment transactions. Microsoft offers Fraud Protection under the Microsoft Online Services Terms, which includes robust Data Protection Terms.

To review the Microsoft Online Services Terms, which include Fraud Protection-specific provisions, to determine if Fraud Protection meets your requirements, visit: https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products.

It is your responsibility to:

- Inform your customers of your data processing practice, for example by disclosing the data you collect and how it is used. 
- Disclose your use of third parties working on your behalf to process the data you collect, including Fraud Protection service providers. 
- Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of Fraud Protection, including data protection laws. 

## Start with transparency 

Prior to implementing Fraud Protection, make sure the privacy disclosures in your ecommerce experience describe how you use personal data, including how it is used to prevent and detect fraud. You can leverage the Fraud Protection documentation to meet your transparency needs. 

## Honor data subject requests

Fraud Protection provides tools to help you comply with data subject requests from your customers. These tools enable you to delete and export customer data from the service which has not been processed using deidentification techniques in the fraud network. Data processed in the fraud network cannot be accessed, exported, viewed, or deleted.
