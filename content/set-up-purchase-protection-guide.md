## Prerequisites 

To set up Fraud Protection and control user access to your data, you must have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD (Active Directory)) tenant. If you do not already have an Azure AD tenant, please contact your authorized Microsoft seller or partner to sign up for one. 
Before you can install Fraud Protection, an authorized Microsoft seller or partner must provide a promotion code to you. If you do not have a promotion code, contact your authorized Microsoft seller or partner.

To help you get started with setting up Purchase Protection, we have provided the steps below with related onboarding and integration document links from this site for quick reference. Follow the doc links below to walk through the provisioning, integration, and key features.  


## Onboarding & Integration Steps with Doc Links

### Step 1: Overview of Dynamics Fraud Protection

### Step 3: Onboarding Planning and Implementation Milestones for Purchase Protection  

Onboarding planning will help you understand and plan for the project implementation milestones of purchase protection integration and onboarding. Follow this link to learn more.  
- [Onboarding planning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/pp-onboarding-planning-guide)

### Step 4: Provisioning Fraud Protection in INT (Sandbox) and PROD 

Fraud protection is provisioned into an Azure AAD (Azure Active Directory) Tenant. You can either provision Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection into your existing AAD tenant or a new AAD tenant. Follow these links for more information.

- [Set up a purchased instance of Fraud Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/promocode-set-up-dfp-purchased-version)

Managing Environments (for partners or customers with multiple Fraud Protection environments) Microsoft Dynamics Fraud Protection provides the option for partners and customers to create multiple environments, allowing for customization of their setup in a way that meets their specific needs. This feature offers flexibility in establishing a hierarchy that is suitable for their requirements. 
- [Manage environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/manage-psp-environments)

### Step 5: Configure User Access and Assign Roles  
 
You can grant users various levels of access to the service, based on logical or functional roles.  
 - [Configure user roles and access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/configure-user-access)
 - [User roles and access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/user-roles-access)
 - [Payment service provider user roles and access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/psp-user-roles)
 
### Step 6: Review APIs and Data Mapping for Purchase Protection 

In this step, your authorized Microsoft partner should collaborate with you to check that your available data aligns with our APIs and provides sufficient information to run machine learning models and generate scores effectively.  
- [Integrate purchase protection APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/integrate-real-time-api)
- [Labels API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/labels-api)

### Step 7: Integrate Purchase Protection APIs 

Collaborate with your authorized Microsoft partner, to confirm your questions are addressed and APIs are properly integrated, as outlined in this guide.
- [Swagger UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/swagger)

### Step 8: Integrate Device Fingerprinting  

Dynamics Fraud Protection offers a sophisticated Device Fingerprinting functionality that significantly enhances our model scoring. Device fingerprinting can be integrated into either the partner's hosted page or the merchant's webpage. Please visit our Swagger UI (user interfaces) to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resource which can be found in this link
- [Set up device fingerprinting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fraud-protection/device-fingerprinting)

### Step 9: Test and Validate Purchase Protection  

In this stage, as test traffic begins to flow into our Sandbox environment, please contact your authorized Microsoft partner to confirm that your data is being received. Upon successful completion of these validations, the integration process can then proceed to its full implementation in production environments. Please let your authorized Microsoft partner know that you have started sending traffic to confirm the data was received. 

 
### Step 10: Continuous Operations and Features 

At this stage, you will begin setting up your purchase protection features and operations. Customers can determine their own unique set of rules, velocities, and leverage other features as needed to best serve the needs of their business.
