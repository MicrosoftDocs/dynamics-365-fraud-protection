# Event tracing

## Overview

The *event tracing* functionality in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection portal lets you establish a real-time telemetry platform that is extensible and operational outside the portal. Each event is either scheduled or triggered by a user-level or system-level action. You can subscribe to events that you're interested in and forward the event payloads to Azure Event Hubs. You can also request events from multiple event tracing sessions at the same time. The system will then deliver the events to Event Hubs in chronological order.

Events can be aggregated and used to define metrics that you can use to monitor and manage your service costs and utilization. Events can also be used to maintain system logs for actions that are taken in the Fraud Protection portal (for example, *user A* edited *list B* on *date C*) or to develop custom reports that use transactional data. When you use the Event Hubs connectors that are available in Power Automate and Logic Apps, you can also use the data that you send to Event Hubs for alerting or highly customized workflows.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to start to use the event tracing functionality.

1. In the [Fraud Protection](https://dfp.microsoft.com/) portal, select **Data**, and then select **Event Tracing**.
1. Select **New subscription**.
1. Provide the connection string for the instance of Event Hubs, and select an event to forward to that instance. For more information, see [Get an Event Hubs connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).

    Before you save the page, you will see a description of the event and a sample of the schema/payload that is included.

1. Events are instantaneously sent to your Event Hubs instance. Go back to the [Fraud Protection](https://dfp.microsoft.com/) portal to view the count for the **Events/Second** metric and make sure that data is being sent to Event Hubs.

    The **Events/Second** and **Failures/Second** metrics show an average over the past 24 hours.

    > [!TIP]
    > For additional monitoring, go to the Azure portal, and set up metrics. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs metrics in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-metrics-azure-monitor).

1. Optional: Set up your own ingress pipeline from Event Hubs to Power BI. For information about how to start to develop custom reports, see [Stream Analytics and Power BI: A real-time analytics dashboard for streaming data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard).
1. Optional: Connect to Event Hubs from Power Automate to define custom workflows. For more information, see [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/eventhubs/).

## Event schemas

Four supported classifications of events are currently available in event tracing: *trace events*, *audit events*, *monitoring events*, and *transactional events*.

### Transactional events
Use transactional events to create custom scorecards and automated workflows using the data available in your assessment and non-assessment API calls. Using blob storage, you can also copy the data from historical API calls to create a data warehouse for your business. The payload for this event includes the entire request and response for each API call.

##### Namespace: FraudProtection.Observe.\<API Name\> or FraudProtection.Assessment.\<API Name\>

```json
{
    "uniqueId": "unique event id and used to deduplicate events",
    "request": {
        //API request payload
    },
    "response": {
        //API response payload
    },
    "name": "FraudProtection.Observe.AccountLabel",
    "version": "1.0",
    "metadata": {
        "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
        "timestamp": "2020-09-25T03:46:53.3716978Z"
    }
}
```

### Trace events

You use trace events to report and monitor the performance for all rules which include the Trace() return type. The payload for this event includes standardized fields such as the name of the rule which triggered the event, the event type which correlates to the assessment type for that rule, correlation ID, etc. You can then send custom attributes using key:value pairs in the Trace() return type to include variables from the sample payload, the risk score, and custom fields. For more information on how to use Trace() in your rules to trigger these events, click [Rules language guide](fpl-lang-ref.md#additional-return-types).

#### Namespace: FraudProtection.Trace.Rule

```json
{
    "name": "FraudProtection.Trace.Rule",
    "version": "1.0",
    "metadata":
{
    "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
    "timestamp": "2020-06-10T23:43:33.4526859Z" 
}
    "ruleName": "Risk Score Policy",
    "eventType": "Purchase",
    "correlationId": "e49319e6-0bea-4567-9f3e-c9f873fc958a",
    "eventId": "e75e703c-1e54-4d41-af4b-a4c1b8866f02",
    "attributes":
{
      "example": "ManualReview‚Äù //key:value pairs defined in the Trace() return type
} 

    }
```

### Audit events

You use audit events to track portal actions and develop an audit log. Audit events currently support EditList/EditRule, NewList/NewRule, and DeleteList/DeleteRule operations.

#### Namespace: FraudProtection.Audit

```json
"audit": {
    "entityId": "cde1518f-305e-42e8-8d05-9b955efe3f46",
    "entityName": "Manual Review Rule",
    "entityType": "Rule",
    "operationName": "NewRule",
    "userId": "user@contoso.com"
},
"name": "FraudProtection.Audit",
"version": "1.0",
"metadata": {
    "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
    "timestamp": "2020-06-10T23:43:33.4526859Z"
}
```

### Monitoring events

You use metrics for metering and monitoring reporting outside the Fraud Protection portal. Request counts and latency distribution events are sent every 20 seconds. These events include **startTime** and **endTime** fields that determine the aggregation period, and dimension names and values that can be used to filter the metrics as required.

##### Namespace: FraudProtection.Monitoring.RequestLatencyMsDistribution

```json

{
"Index": [
             1
],
"BucketSamples": [
             2
],
"NumberOfBuckets": 10000,
"BucketSize": 10,
"MinimumValue": 0,
"CounterName": "RequestLatencyMsDistribution",
"DimensionNames": [
   "EnvironmentId",
   "TenantId",
   "ApiName",
   "ExperienceType",
   "IsTestRequest",
   "RequestType",
   "HttpRequestStatus",
   "HttpStatusCode"
],
"DimensionValues": [
   "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
   "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
   "v1.0/Observe/Create",
   "N/A",
   "False",
   "REALTIME",
   "Success",
   "200"
],
"StartTime": "2020-06-22T23:43:20",
"EndTime": "2020-06-22T23:43:40",
"Samples": 2,
"Min": 3,
"Max": 7,
"name": "FraudProtection.Monitoring.RequestLatencyMsDistribution",
"version": "1.0",
"metadata": {
   "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
   "timestamp": "2020-06-22T23:43:20.0947542Z"
}
}

```

The *Samples* field represents the request count per API.
