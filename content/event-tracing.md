# Event tracing

The *event tracing* functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection (Fraud Protection) lets you establish a real-time telemetry platform that is extensible and operational outside the portal. Each event is either scheduled or triggered by a user-level or system-level action. You can subscribe to events that you're interested in and forward the event payloads to Azure Event Hubs or Blob Storage. You can also request events from multiple event tracing sessions at the same time. The system will then deliver the events in chronological order.

Events can be aggregated and used to define metrics that you can use to monitor and manage your service costs and utilization. Events can also be used to maintain system logs for actions that are taken in the Fraud Protection portal (for example, *user A* edited *list B* on *date C*) or to develop custom reports that use transactional data. When you use the Event Hubs connectors that are available in Power Automate and Logic Apps, you can also use the data that you send to Event Hubs for alerting or highly customized workflows. Similarly, with Blob Storage you can create a new subscription which will copy all historical data into your cold storage account for further analysis.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to start to use the event tracing functionality.

1. In the [Fraud Protection](https://dfp.microsoft.com/) portal, select **Data**, and then select **Event Tracing**.
1. Select **New subscription**.
1. Enter a subscription display name.
1. Select a storage location:
   1. **For Event Hubs**: Enter the connection string for the Event Hubs instance. Make sure that this is not the namespace connection string, and that it includes **Manage**, **Send**, and **Listen** privileges. For more information, see [Get an Event Hubs connection string](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).
   
   1. **For Blob Storage**: Enter the connection string for your Azure storage account. Then enter a container name where your event tracing data will reside. For more information, see [View account access keys](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal#view-account-access-keys).

1.	Select an event and review the description and sample of the JSON payload before saving the subscription by selecting **Create**. 

     Events are instantaneously sent to your Event Hubs instance from that point in time. If you selected Blob Storage, the copy process to write all historical data will begin and all events will be published to your container every 30 minutes. 
   
1.	Go back to the [Fraud Protection](https://dfp.microsoft.com/) portal to view the count for the **Events/Hr.** metric and make sure that data is being sent to Event Hubs and Blob Storage.

    The **Events/Hr** and **Failures/Hr** metrics show an average over the past 24 hours.

    > [!TIP]
    > For additional monitoring for Event Hubs, go to the Azure portal, and set up metrics. For more information, see [Azure Event Hubs metrics in Azure Monitor](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-metrics-azure-monitor).

1. Optional: Set up your own ingress pipeline from Event Hubs to Power BI. For information about how to start to develop custom reports, see [Work with Power BI](./extensibility-with-power-bi.md).

1. Optional: Connect to Event Hubs from Power Automate to define custom workflows. For more information, see [Work with Logic Apps or Power Automate](./extensibility-with-power-automate.md).

## Event schemas

Four supported classifications of events are currently available in event tracing: *trace events*, *audit events*, *monitoring events*, and *transactional events*.

### Transactional events
Use transactional events to create custom scorecards and automated workflows using the data available in your assessment and non-assessment API calls. Using blob storage, you can also copy the data from historical API calls to create a data warehouse for your business. The payload for this event includes the entire request and response for each API call.

##### Namespace: FraudProtection.Observe.\<API Name\> or FraudProtection.Assessment.\<API Name\>

```json
{
    "uniqueId": "unique event id and used to deduplicate events",
    "request": {
        //API request payload
    },
    "response": {
        //API response payload
    },
    "name": "FraudProtection.Observe.AccountLabel",
    "version": "1.0",
    "metadata": {
        "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
        "timestamp": "2020-09-25T03:46:53.3716978Z"
    }
}
```

### Trace events

You use trace events to report and monitor the performance for all rules which include the Trace() return type. The payload for this event includes standardized fields such as the name of the rule which triggered the event, the event type which correlates to the assessment type for that rule, correlation ID, etc. You can then send custom attributes using key:value pairs in the Trace() return type to include variables from the sample payload, the risk score, and custom fields. For more information on how to use Trace() in your rules to trigger these events, see [Observation functions](fpl-lang-ref.md#observation-functions) in the Rules language guide.

##### Namespace: FraudProtection.Trace.Rule.

```json
{
    "name": "FraudProtection.Trace.Rule",
    "version": "1.0",
    "metadata":
{
    "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
    "timestamp": "2020-06-10T23:43:33.4526859Z" 
}
    "ruleName": "Risk Score Policy",
    "eventType": "Purchase",
    "correlationId": "e49319e6-0bea-4567-9f3e-c9f873fc958a",
    "eventId": "e75e703c-1e54-4d41-af4b-a4c1b8866f02",
    "attributes":
{
      "example": "ManualReview‚Äù //key:value pairs defined in the Trace() return type
} 

    }
```

### Audit events

You use audit events to track portal actions and develop an audit log. Audit events currently support new/edit/delete operations on rules, lists, velocities, and external calls.

##### Namespace: FraudProtection.Audit.

```json
"audit": {
    "entityId": "cde1518f-305e-42e8-8d05-9b955efe3f46",
    "entityName": "Manual Review Rule",
    "entityType": "Rule",
    "operationName": "NewRule",
    "userId": "user@contoso.com"
},
"name": "FraudProtection.Audit",
"version": "1.0",
"metadata": {
    "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
    "timestamp": "2020-06-10T23:43:33.4526859Z"
}
```

### Monitoring events

You can use monitoring events for custom reporting and alerting on your API and external calls performance in conjunction with the reporting available in the Fraud Protection portal. Each of the events below will provide insight into the latency and errors for each service.

##### Namespace: FraudProtection.Monitoring.RequestLatencyMsDistribution.

For API calls, request counts and latency distributions (in ms) are sent every 20 seconds in this event. These events include startTime and endTime fields that determine the aggregation period and dimension names and values that can be used to filter the metrics as required.

```json

{
"Index": [
             1
],
"BucketSamples": [
             2
],
"NumberOfBuckets": 10000,
"BucketSize": 10,
"MinimumValue": 0,
"CounterName": "RequestLatencyMsDistribution",
"DimensionNames": [
   "EnvironmentId",
   "TenantId",
   "ApiName",
   "ExperienceType",
   "IsTestRequest",
   "RequestType",
   "HttpRequestStatus",
   "HttpStatusCode"
],
"DimensionValues": [
   "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
   "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
   "v1.0/Observe/Create",
   "N/A",
   "False",
   "REALTIME",
   "Success",
   "200"
],
"StartTime": "2020-06-22T23:43:20",
"EndTime": "2020-06-22T23:43:40",
"Samples": 2,
"Min": 3,
"Max": 7,
"name": "FraudProtection.Monitoring.RequestLatencyMsDistribution",
"version": "1.0",
"metadata": {
   "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
   "timestamp": "2020-06-22T23:43:20.0947542Z"
}
}

```

The *Samples* field represents the request count per API.

**Namespace: FraudProtection.Monitoring.ExternalCalls**

This event includes the latency (in ms) and HTTP status code of each external call *<link to external call doc>* which is triggered from a rule. Additional dimensions for the rule and clause triggering the call are also provided.

For external calls, latency (in ms) and http status code metrics are sent with each request in this event. Additional dimensions for the rule triggering the call are also provided to improve the troubleshooting experience if you were interested in investigating the performance of an individual call.

```json

{
    "name": "FraudProtection.Monitoring.ExternalCalls",
    "version": "1.0",
    "metadata": {
        "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
        "timestamp": "2020-06-10T23:43:33.4526859Z"
    },
    "externalCallName": "SampleExternalCall",
    "requestStatus": "Success",
    "httpStatusCode": 200,
    "correlationId": "50BFA0D6-1E3D-4700-A2B3-1DD01162C08A",
    "latencyMs": 123,
    "assessment": "PURCHASE",
    "rule": "SampleRule",
    "clause": "SampleClause"
}

```

**Namespace: FraudProtection.Errors.ExternalCalls**

This event logs errors for each failed external call, and can be useful for debugging any issues you may see with your external call performance. The full request and response for the call will be logged, as well as the latency, and the rule and clause the call were triggered from.

```json

{
    "name": "FraudProtection.Errors.ExternalCalls",
    "version": "1.0",
    "metadata": {
        "tenantId": "63f55d63-9653-4ed9-be77-294da21202ae",
        "timestamp": "2020-06-10T23:43:33.4526859Z"
    },
    "externalCallName": "SampleExternalCall",
    "requestStatus": "ResponseFailure",
    "httpStatusCode": 404,
    "correlationId": "50BFA0D6-1E3D-4700-A2B3-1DD01162C08A",
    "latencyMs": 123,
    "assessment": "PURCHASE",
    "rule": "SampleRule",
    "clause": "SampleClause",
    "response": "{}",
    "requestUri": "https://samplewebsite/sample",
    "requestBody": "{}"
}

```
