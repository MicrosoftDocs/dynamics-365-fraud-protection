# In-product notifications

[!include[deprecation](includes/deprecation.md)]

In the **Notification Center** of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection portal, you can view critical and non-critical notifications. Notifications are listed in order from newest to oldest. You can also view critical notifications on the **Notification Message Bar** that's located under the page header of every portal page.

The notification icon in the upper-right corner of the portal shows the count of unread notifications. You can filter notifications by type, including **Critical**, **Error**, **Information**, **Success**, or **Warning**. Select the link in a notification to go to the related feature page, where you can learn more or take required action. 

You can view notifications for environments that you have permission to based on the [roles and access](user-roles-access.md) that are assigned to you. You can view cross-environment notifications, which include the environment name, without having to switch environments. By default, a user from the Fraud Protection root environment will receive notifications from the child environments.  

You're automatically subscribed to your role-related notifications. To subscribe to and unsubscribe from notifications by type, you can make updates in the **Notification Settings**. When you're unsubscribed, you'll no longer receive notifications.
