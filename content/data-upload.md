# Upload historical data for purchase protection 

In the evaluate and protect experiences in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you can upload your purchase protection historical data into the system to help train and improve the accuracy of our machine learning models. These uploads include data for purchases, chargebacks, merchant and bank decisions, and accounts.

## Data types

Historical data can be uploaded through the Fraud Protection portal or the application programming interface (API).  We recommend uploading at least six months of historical data.

**Entities:**

- Purchases

    - Purchases
    - Payment instruments
    - Products

- Purchase status
- Bank events
- Chargebacks
- Refunds
- Labels
- Account

    - Update accounts
    - Update account addresses
    - Update account payment instruments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This data is sensitive, and you should take care to upload it only from a secure network location. Be aware that Microsoft requests only partial data about payment instruments (the bank identification number \[BIN\] and the last four digits). We don't request the full payment instrument number or Social Security number (SSN). We recommend that you do **not** include this type of data in the files that you upload. For more information about how data is used and protected in Fraud Protection, see [Security, compliance, and data subject requests](security-compliance.md).

## Website upload

Upload your historical data on the **Purchase protection** tab in the **Data upload** page.

To ensure that Fraud Protection correctly interprets your files, follow these requirements and review the [required schemas](schema.md):

- The files are in CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) format (\*.csv).
- The maximum file size is 10 gigabytes (GB).
- **DateTime** columns are in ISO 8601 format.
- The decimal precision is two decimal places.
- The following characters are escaped in all columns: commas, new line characters, and multiline characters.

**To browse and upload data files:**

1. On the left navigation, select **Data**, and then select **Data upload**.
1. On the **Data upload** page, select the **Purchase protection** tab, and then select **Select data source**. 
1. Select the file format type: **CSV** or **TSV**. 
1. If the file has no column headers, select the **This file doesnâ€™t include column headers** option. 

   The system will automatically assign default column headers. 
   
1. To create data mapping, select **Next**, and then select the columns in your file that will be mapped to each schema attribute. 
1. In the data preview pane at the bottom of the page, confirm that the mapping is correct. 
1. When all the attributes are mapped, select **Save and close** to return to the **Data upload** page. 
1. Select **Process data**. 

  You can save an incomplete mapping and return to the **Purchase protection** tab to complete it later. 
  
  For related data types, such as purchase and account data, every file must be uploaded before you process the data.
  
**To upload additional data files:** 

1. On the **Data upload** page, select the **Purchase protection** tab, and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **Change data source** to upload more files. 
1. To apply the currently-saved mapping to the newly uploaded file, select **Keep the current mapping**. 
1. After mapping is complete, select **Save and close**.
1. On the **Data upload** page, select **Process data**.
 
Data processing may take up to a few hours depending on the size of the file. You can check the status of data processing for each data source. 
If data processing encounters data errors, processing will fail, and the data import will be incomplete. Review the error file details and fix the noted data issue. After fixing the issues, re-upload the fixed file, re-map the attributes if needed, and retry data processing. 

**To remove previously uploaded data files:**
- On the **Purchase protection** tab in the **Data upload** page, select the files you want to remove, and then select **Delete**.


## API upload

Data can also be ingested through the AP during the evaluate and protect experiences. A score will be returned for data that you upload in this way. For a more comprehensive overview of this process, see [Integrate Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection APIs](integrate-real-time-api.md).

## Download sample data
You can download  sample data and use this data to explore Fraud Protection options before using your internal data.
