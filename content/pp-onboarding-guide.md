> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft would perform data validation, but merchant needs to enable the API calls and start sending a small percentage of production traffic first. Post validation, merchants can send all traffic which will help the project move to the next step. 

### Data Accumulation Phase (Est. 4 weeks)
<!--Step 3-->

No actions for Merchant and Microsoft/Authorized Partner during this phase. Accumulation starts right after data quality is signed off during API integration phase. Continue forward once the criteria below have been achieved:                                                                                                               
- At least 500 fraudulent transactions                                                                      
- At least 5000 non-fraudulent transactions                                                                    
- At least 4 weeks data with more than 70% label maturity rate
