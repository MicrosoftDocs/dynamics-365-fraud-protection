# Threat vulnerability trend tool (preview version)
[!include [preview banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection threat vulnerability trend tool (preview) is provided as a preview service under terms and conditions described in the Microsoft Online Service Terms. The threat vulnerability trend tool enables merchants to track long-term key operational metrics, analyze account protection session trends, and make informed operational decisions such as setting score threshold, segmenting threat traffic, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing abusive traffic pattern, and validating machine learning (ML) score performance. The interactive tool provides intelligence on various dimensions including geolocation, device configuration, IP, and reason code.

The threat vulnerability trend is an interactive report tool built on the Microsoft Power BI platform. You can use this tool to identify threat vulnerability trends for account protection in you online systems by applying various filters, changing the score threshold, and viewing an analysis of historical trends.

The threat vulnerability trend report refreshes every 24 hours with the latest account protection historical data. The time stamp in the report displays the UTC refresh time for the report. The threat vulnerability trend tool retains account login and account creation data from the past 4 months. Reports may show empty results due to insufficient data.

The threat vulnerability trend includes the following report tabs.

- **Summary**: Helps to visualize key metrics, distributions, and trends at a high level.

- **Hourly Heat Map**: Displays hourly distribution of volume, average bot, and risk score to help identify seasonality and anomalies.

- **Week Over Week**: Provides a comparison between the selected date and the remaining dates of the week, to validate whether a weekly pattern holds. Helps to identify trends and fraud patterns.

- **Day Over Day**: Provides a comparison between the selected date and the past 6 days, to validate if a daily pattern holds. Helps to identify trends and fraud patterns.

- **Location Distribution**: Displays volume distribution and relative volume for the selected location as compared to total traffic at the country or state level.

- **Score Distribution**: Displays bot and risk score distribution and cumulative percentage. Helps optimize the score threshold and estimate impact.

- **Reason Code**: Slices traffic by bot and risk model reason code to help you understand the most significant factors provided by the model.

- **Status**: Displays score distribution by session status and status changes over time. Validates the efficacy of the score against the given session status.

- **Label**: Displays score distribution by label state and label changes over time. Validates the efficacy of the score against the given label state.

- **Device Configuration**: Displays traffic distribution by device configuration properties such as operating system and browser.

## Summary

You can configure the filter and granularity options on the top of the **Summary** page. 

The summary report displays high-level metrics such as volume, percentage with no geolocation, average bot score, and average risk score.

Charts that are available on the summary report include:

- **Volume by location**: Displays volume in a map layout.

- **Top ten volume location by bot score and risk score category**: Display is based on the selected location granularity option.

- **Volume, average bot, and risk score by period**: Displays time series of the key metrics based on the selected date granularity.

- **Volume for not approved by period**: Displays volume of transactions with approved, rejected, and pending status, based on the selected date granularity.

- **Volume for label state by period**: Displays volume of transactions with various labels, based on the selected date granularity. 

## Hourly heat map

The hourly heat map displays hourly high-level metrics and distribution of the volume, average bot, and average risk score to help you identify seasonality and anomalies. For example, an unusual volume spike or high score at 1:00 AM may indicate a fraud attack. 

Charts that are available on the hourly heat map include:

- **Volume by day of week and hour of day**: Displays volume at each hour of every day of the week. The higher the volume, the darker the color shade is for the given hour of a day in a week.

- **Average bot score by day of week/hour of day**: Displays average bot score at each hour of every day of week. The higher the bot score, the darker the color shade is for the given hour of day in a week.

- **Average risk score by day of week/hour of day**: Displays average risk score at each hour of every day of week. The higher the risk score, the darker the color shade is for the given hour of day in a week.

## Week over week

The week over week report provides a comparison of the selected date and the remaining days of that week with previous weeks. You can use this report to validate whether a weekly pattern holds, and to identify trends and fraud patterns. For example, if a certain day of the week has an unusually high volume or high score as compared to prior weeks, it may indicate a potential threat attack.

Charts that are available on the week over week report include:

- **Hourly volume by day of week**: Displays hourly volume on the selected date and compares it to the volume on the same day of the week for prior weeks. Up to 4 prior weeks can be displayed.

- **Hourly average bot score by day of week**: Displays hourly average bot score on the selected date and compares it to the score on the same day of the week for prior weeks. Up to 4 prior weeks can be displayed.

- **Hourly average risk score by day of week**: Displays hourly average risk score on the selected date and compares it to the score on the same day of the week for prior weeks. Up to 4 prior weeks can be displayed.


## Day over day

The day over day report provides a comparison between the selected date and the previous 6 days. You can use this report to validate whether a daily pattern holds and to identify trends and fraud patterns. For example, if a certain day has an unusually high volume or high score as compared to prior days, it may indicate a potential threat attack.

Charts that are available on the day over day report include:

- **Hourly volume by day**: Displays hourly volume on the selected date and compares it to the volume on the previous 6 days.

- **Hourly average bot score by day**: Displays hourly average bot score on the selected date and compares it to the average score on the previous 6 days.

- **Hourly average risk score by day of week**: Displays hourly average risk score on the selected date and compares it to the average score on the previous 6 days.

## Location distribution

The location distribution report displays the volume distribution and relative volume on a selected location and compares it to the total traffic at the country/region or state level. For example, a sudden increase of volume from a certain location may indicate a potential attack. Location distribution also displays high-level metrics such as total volume and populate rate.

Charts that are available on the location distribution report include:

- **Top 10 country/region volume distribution and populate rate**: Displays top 10 countries/regions with highest volume distribution and populate rate change over time.

- **Top 10 state volume distribution**: Displays top 10 states/provinces with highest volume distribution over time.

- **Top 10 location volume % of total traffic**: Displays top 10 locations based on selected granularity (state/province or country/region) with the highest volume percentage of total traffic over time.

- **Top 10 location volume**: Displays top 10 locations based on selected granularity (state/province or country/region) with the highest volume over time.

## Score distribution

The score distribution report displays the bot and risk score distribution and cumulative percentage, to help you optimize the score threshold and estimate impact. For example, at a specific score bin you can infer from the cumulative percentage chart what the percentage of total traffic that may be rejected will be when the score threshold is applied. The transaction period volume by bot and risk score bin helps you identify trends and anomalies on the score.

Charts that are available on the score distribution report include:

- **Volume and cumulative percentage by bot score bin**: Displays volume and cumulative percentage by bot score bin, including special scores defined in the [appendix](threat-vulnerability-trend.md#Appendix).

## Status

Status visualizes score distribution by session status and status changes over time, which validates the efficacy of the score against the given the session status. For example, if the sessions with high risk score have more rejected status comparing to sessions with low risk score, it indicates that the risk model is effective in identifying suspicious sessions.

Charts available on Status includes:

-   Status distribution, a table of statuses and their volume, average bot score and average risk score.

## Label

Label visualizes score distribution by session status and status changes over time, which validates the efficacy of the score against the given the label state. For example, if the sessions with high risk score have more session identified as fraud comparing to sessions with low risk score, it indicates that the risk model is effective in identifying fraudulent sessions.

Charts available on Label includes:

-   Status distribution, a table of label states and their volume, average bot score and average risk score.
