# Threat Vulnerability Trend (Preview version)

The Fraud Protection Threat Vulnerability Trend (Preview) tool is provided to you as a Preview service under terms and conditions described in the Microsoft Online Service Terms. The Threat Vulnerability Trend is a tool that allows customers to track long term key operational metrics, analyze Account Protection session trend, and make informed operational decisions such as setting the score threshold, segmenting threat traffic, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing abusive traffic pattern, and validating ML score performance. The interactive tool provides intelligence on various dimensions including geolocation, device configuration, IP, reason code, and etc.

The Threat Vulnerability Trend is an interactive report tool built on the Microsoft Power BI platform. Customers can use this tool to identify threat vulnerability trend for account protection in their online systems by applying various filters, changing the score threshold, and viewing an analysis of historical trend.

The Threat Vulnerability Trend report refreshes every 24 hours with the latest Account Protection historical data. The time stamp in the report displays the UTC refresh time for the report. The TVT retains account login and account creation data from past 4 months. Reports may show empty results due to insufficient data.

The Threat Vulnerability Trend is composed of the following report tabs:

- **Summary**, which visualize key metrics, distributions, and trends at high level.

- **Hourly Heat Map**, which visualize hourly distribution of the volume, average bot and risk score to identify seasonality and anomaly.

- **Week Over Week**, it gives comparison between selected date and rest of the dates on selected day of week to validate if weekly pattern holds and identify trends and fraud patterns.

- **Day Over Day**, it gives comparison between selected date and past 6 days to validate if daily pattern holds and identify trends and fraud patterns.

- **Location Distribution**, which visualizes volume distribution and relative volume on selected location comparing to total traffic at country or state level.

- **Score Distribution**, which visualizes bot and risk score distribution and cumulative percentage to optimize score threshold and estimate impact.

- **Reason Code**, it slices the traffic by bot and risk model reason code and help the customer understand most significant factors provided by the model.

- **Status**, it visualizes score distribution by session status and status changes over time, which validates the efficacy of the score against the given session status.

- **Label**, it visualizes score distribution by label state and label changes over time, which validates the efficacy of the score against the given label state.

- **Device Configuration**, which shows traffic distribution by device configuration properties, such as Operating System and Browser.

## Summary

Like most pages in the Threat Vulnerability Trend, customers can configure the filter and granularity options on top of the page. Please refer to the Appendix on filters and options available in the TVT.

Summary report shows high level metrics such as volume, % of no geolocation, average bot score and average risk score to provide insights.

Charts available on summary report includes:

-   Volume by location in a map layout

-   Top 10 volume location by bot score and risk score category, which will render based on the selected location granularity option.

-   Volume, average bot & risk score by period, which shows time series of the key metrics based on the selected date granularity.

-   Volume for labels by period, which shows not approved label based on the selected date granularity.

## Hourly Heat Map

Hourly Heat Map visualizes hourly distribution of the volume, average bot and risk score to identify seasonality and anomaly. For example, an unusual volume spike or high score at 1AM may indicate fraud attack. Hourly Heat Map also shows high level metrics such as volume, average bot score and average risk score to provide insights.

Charts available on Hourly Heat Map includes:

-   Volume by day of week/hour of day, which shows volume at each hour of every day of week, the higher the volume the darker the color shade is for the given hour of day in a week.

-   Average bot score by day of week/hour of day, which shows average bot score at each hour of every day of week, the higher the bot score the darker the color shade is for the given hour of day in a week.

-   Average risk score by day of week/hour of day, which shows average risk score at each hour of every day of week, the higher the risk score the darker the color shade is for the given hour of day in a week.

## Week Over Week

Week Over Week gives comparison between selected date and rest of the dates on selected day of week to validate if weekly pattern holds and identify trends and fraud patterns. For example, if a certain day has unusual high volume or high score comparing to the prior weeks it indicates a potential threat attack.

Charts available on Week Over Week includes:

-   Hourly volume by day of week, which shows hourly volume and compare selected date with same day of the week for up to 4 weeks prior.

-   Hourly average bot score by day of week, which shows hourly average bot score and compare selected date with same day of the week for up to 4 weeks prior.

-   Hourly average risk score by day of week, which shows hourly average risk score and compare selected date with same day of the week for up to 4 weeks prior.

## Day Over Day

Day Over Day gives comparison between selected date and past 6 days to validate if daily pattern holds and identify trends and identify trends and fraud patterns. For example, if a certain day has unusual high volume or high score comparing to the prior days it indicates a potential threat attack.

Charts available on Day Over Day includes:

-   Hourly volume by day, which shows hourly volume and compare selected date with past 6 days.

-   Hourly average bot score by day, which shows hourly average bot score and compare selected date with past 6 days.

-   Hourly average risk score by day of week, which shows hourly average risk score and compare selected date with past 6 days.

## Location Distribution

Location Distribution visualizes volume distribution and relative volume on selected location comparing to total traffic at country or state level. For example, a sudden increase of volume from certain location may indicates a potential attack. Location Distribution also shows high level metrics such as total volume and populated rate to provide quick overview.

Charts available on Location Distribution includes:

-   Top 10 country volume distribution and populate rate, which shows countries/regions with highest volume distribution and populated rate change over time.

-   Top 10 state volume distribution, which shows states/provinces with highest volume distribution over time.

-   Top 10 location volume % of total traffic, which shows top location based on selected granularity (

-   state/province, or country/region) volume percentage over time.

-   Top 10 location volume, which shows top location based on selected granularity (state/province, or country/region) volume over time.

## Score Distribution

Score Distribution visualizes bot and risk score distribution and cumulative percentage to optimize score threshold and estimate impact. For example, at certain score bin we can see from the cumulative percentage chart what will be the percentage of total traffic could be rejected by applying the score threshold. The Transaction period volume by bot and risk score bin provides a view to identify trends and anomaly on the score.

Charts available on Score Distribution includes:

-   Volume and cumulative percentage by bot score bin, which shows volume and cumulative percentage by bot score bin, including special score defined in the Appendix.

## Status

Status visualizes score distribution by session status and status changes over time, which validates the efficacy of the score against the given the session status. For example, if the sessions with high risk score have more rejected status comparing to sessions with low risk score, it indicates that the risk model is effective in identifying suspicious sessions.

Charts available on Status includes:

## Label

Label visualizes score distribution by session status and status changes over time, which validates the efficacy of the score against the given the label state. For example, if the sessions with high risk score have more session identified as fraud comparing to sessions with low risk score, it indicates that the risk model is effective in identifying fraudulent sessions.

Charts available on Label includes:
