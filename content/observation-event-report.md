# Observation event report

Fraud Protection provides observation event report that is designed to showcase insights from observation events or labeled events for [Assessments](assessment-create-new.md) only. To activate the observation event report, you need to navigate to the [Assessment configuration](assessment-configure-existing.md) page, select the observation event, and choose the relevant data fields to setup the metrics. Changes made to the report configuration could take a maximum of 24 hours to be displayed.   

You can select time series view or score view in this report. Based on the filters you have selected, the following metrics are available. 
- **Observation event distribution in time series** â€“ value distribution based on your configuration in time series. 
- **Observation event distribution by score** - value distribution based on your configuration by score.
