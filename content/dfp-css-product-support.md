# Get support for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection

After you complete the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection onboarding process, you may want additional support from someone at Microsoft. If you used a Microsoft partner to help with  onboarding, contact that partner for support with Fraud Protection. If you haven't worked with a Microsoft partner, you should contact Microsoft Support. 
> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has a service contract such as Microsoft Unified, your Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM) can provide additional guidance.

There are two ways you can contact Microsoft Support. 

- **Call suport directly**. Refer to [Global Customer Service phone numbers - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/global-customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2) to find support contact numbers for your country/region. Support is available for all Fraud Protection customers.    

- **Submit a support ticket**. In the Fraud Protection portal, select **?** in the top corner and then select **Create support request**. Submit your ticket on the support portal that displays.
> [!NOTE]
> You must have global admin permissions to submit a ticket from the Fraud Protection portal.

When you call support or submit a support ticket from the Fraud Protection portal, you must provide a severity level. The following table details the criteria for each severity level. If you call support, use the “Customer verbiage” as displayed in the table to help the support agent assign the proper severity level. 


| Severity level | Severity level criteria | Response time | Customer verbiage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level A | System down<br>Customer production outage or degradation.<br>Functionality loss resulting in the inability to restore customer production.<br>Issue impacting one or more customers. | One hour or less (24/7) | "Outage" |
| Level B | Customer’s business has moderate loss or degradation of services, but work can reasonably continue in an impaired manner.<br>Average production issue. | Four business hours (local time) | "Production issue" |
| Level C | Customer’s business is functioning with minor impediment of service.<br>Lower priority. | Eight business hours (local time) | "General issue" |
