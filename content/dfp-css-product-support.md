# DFP Product Support

Once you have completed the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection onboarding process, product support may be needed at times. If you utilize a Microsoft partner for your onboarding, please contact them for product support. If you do not have a Microsoft partner, Product Support will be provided by the Microsoft Customer Service and Support (CSS) team. There are two mechanisms for you to contact CSS. Note: If your organization has a service contract such as Microsoft Unified, your Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM) can provide additional guidance.  

**Option 1:** Call CSS directly. CSS contact numbers per country can be found here: [Global Customer Service phone numbers - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/global-customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2). All hours of operation are listed in local times. CSS is available for all Fraud Protection customers.    

**Option 2:** You may submit a CSS ticket directly within the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection portal by clicking the “?” icon in the top-right corner of the portal and selecting “Create support request”.  You will then be taken to a separate CSS portal to submit your ticket.  Note: Global Admin permissions are needed to submit tickets from the Fraud Protection portal.

When you call CSS or submit a service ticket from within the Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection portal, you will be asked to provide a severity level.  The table below outlines the criteria for each level.

If you call CSS, use the “Customer Verbiage” in the last column below to help the CSS agent assign the proper severity level .
