# Attributes in device fingerprinting

The following tables show the device fingerprinting attribute categories that we try to collect for web, iOS, and Android. The description of the attributes explains how each helps detect fraud. If your organization has specific needs, and you want some categories of data not to be processed by Fraud Protection, reach out to customer support before onboarding. Customer support can help you do the configuration correctly to meet your privacy needs.

A different value is returned for apps on the same device that come from different vendors, and for apps on different devices regardless of vendor. Normally, the vendor is determined by data provided by the App Store. If the app wasn't installed from the app store (such as enterprise apps and apps still in development), then a vendor identifier is calculated based on the app’s bundle ID.
