## Does Fraud Protection subcontract any of its data processing activities?

## What procedures does Fraud Protection have in place for disposal of confidential customer data?

Microsoft uses industry standard processes to delete Customer Data and Professional Services Data. Hard disk and offsite backup tape destruction guidelines have been established for appropriate disposal.

## How is data confidentiality assured within Fraud Protection?

Fraud Protection requires all access be authenticated with AAD and implements role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access by another customer and that it follows many security procedures internally to authorize and audit all access to data by Microsoft personnel and allow it only when required to ensure service stability and resolve issues.

As stated in the Microsoft data protection addendum on the [Licensing Documents](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA) site:

_"Microsoft will ensure that its personnel engaged in the processing of Customer Data, Professional Services Data, and Personal Data will process such data only on instructions from Customer or as described in the data protection addendum, and will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of such data even after their engagement ends. Microsoft shall provide periodic and mandatory data privacy and security training and awareness to its employees with access to Customer Data, Professional Services Data, and Personal Data in accordance with applicable Data Protection Requirements and industry standards."_

## Is Fraud Protection subject to any legal or regulatory requirements related to security? If so, what are they and how is Fraud Protection meeting those requirements?

Microsoft is subject to various legal and regulatory obligations. Information concerning security, privacy or compliance can be found at the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/default.aspx).

## What steps does Fraud Protection take to ensure accuracy of the end user data collected and maintained?

It is the responsibility of the merchant to ensure the accuracy of the data.

## Does Fraud Protection provide end users access to data that it collected about them so that users can correct any inaccuracies?

No. 
Any end user wishing to update or access their information should do so through the merchant. That said, Fraud Protection provides customers with tools to assist in managing "End User Data Subject Access Requests".
