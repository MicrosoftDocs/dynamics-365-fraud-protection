# Work with code

You can use code for the following purposes:

- Test that your event hub is working correctly by sending test events to it.
- Listen to and view sample events from the event tracing subscriptions that you set up in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.
- Have full control as you work with eventing data (for example, store events in persistent storage for auditing purposes and run custom automated scripts).

## Getting started

There are many software development kits (SDKs) available for working with events [from Event Hubs in .NET, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Apache Storm](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/sdks). 

For an extensive tutorial about how to send and receive events from Azure Event Hubs, see [Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using JavaScript (azure/event-hubs version 5)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/get-started-node-send-v2). You can also access instructions for the remaining code SDKs from the left navigation in Fraud Protection.

> [!NOTE]
> To *receive* events, you must set up an Azure storage account and blob container. This process is explained in the previously mentioned [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/get-started-node-send-v2). You can use the resource group and event hub that you set up earlier.

## Sample Event Hubs sender and receiver code (JavaScript)

For a sample of working code that sends and receives events to and from Event Hubs via JavaScript, see [Send events to or receive events from event hubs by using JavaScript (azure/event-hubs version 5)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-node-get-started-send).
