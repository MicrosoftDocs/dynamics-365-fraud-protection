# Extensibility via Event Hubs

This content guides you through the process of setting up and using the *event tracing data* that is available from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. This data includes, but isn't limited to, data for *audit log events*, *latency events*, and *trace events*.

Through pure-code software development kits (SDKs), you can integrate this data with your own organization's workflows, requirements for granular control, and custom needs. Additionally, you can take advantage of fast-development tools such as Azure Logic Apps, Power BI, and Power Apps for powerful automation, reports, and applications.

This content is organized into the following main topics:

- [Set up extensibility via Event Hubs](extensibility-setup.md)	
- [Work with code](extensibility-with-code.md)
- [Work with Logic Apps or Power Automate](extensibility-with-power-automate.md)
- [Work with Power BI](extensibility-with-power-bi.md)
- [Work with Power Apps](extensibility-with-power-apps.md)
- [Pricing](extensibility-pricing.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Only the [Set up extensibility via Event Hubs](extensibility-setup.md) topic is *required*. The remaining topics are optional, depending on your organization's needs. Each topic is divided into sections, so that you can skip around and review only the parts that you require. In these topics, the terms *events*, *eventing data*, and *event tracing data* are used interchangeably. 
>
> Be sure to read the notes in each topic *before* you move on to another topic.
