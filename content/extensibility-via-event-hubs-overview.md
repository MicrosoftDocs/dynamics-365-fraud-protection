# Extensibility via Event Hubs

This content guides you through the process of setting up and using the *event tracing data* that is available from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection. This data includes, but isn't limited to, data for *audit log events*, *latency events*, and *trace events*.

Through pure-code software development kits (SDKs), you can integrate this data with your own organization's workflows, requirements for granular control, and custom needs. Additionally, you can take advantage of fast-development tools such as Azure Logic Apps, Power BI, and Power Apps for powerful automation, reports, and applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Event Hub requires additional Azure services subscriptions. Contact your Microsoft Account Executive for details.â€¯If you have Azure global administrator credentials, log into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home) to determine available subscriptions.

This content is organized into the following main articles:

- [Set up extensibility via Event Hubs](extensibility-setup.md)	
- [Work with code](extensibility-with-code.md)
- [Work with Logic Apps or Power Automate](extensibility-with-power-automate.md)
- [Work with Power BI](extensibility-with-power-bi.md)
- [Work with Power Apps](extensibility-with-power-apps.md)


> [!NOTE]
> Only the [Set up extensibility via Event Hubs](extensibility-setup.md) article is *required*. The remaining articles are optional, depending on your organization's needs.
