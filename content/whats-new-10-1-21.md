# What's new in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection October 2021 release

[!include [preview banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection brings together account protection, payment protection, and loss prevention, providing a 360-degree view of the fraud landscape to merchants amplifying them to discover and combat fraud efficiently and effectively. We are releasing 2 new features to amplify our customersâ€™ ability to fight fraud: - Payment Service Provider Enablement (preview) and  Deeper purchase and account protection fraud analytics and reporting .

## Payment Service Provider (PSP) Enabled

Fraud Protection will have multiple new features that enhance Payment Service Providers' ability to offer Fraud Protection as a value-added fraud protection service to all their merchants.

PSPs will be able to integrate Fraud Protection easily into their existing infrastructure to manage PSP taxonomies that encompass many merchants and multiple hierarchies within each merchant entity. PSP-focused experiences will be added to Fraud Protection to manage the creation and addition of multiple merchants and to observe and manage merchant fraud performance across a single merchant, multiple merchants, and across PSP verticals using artificial intelligence and other fraud management features in Fraud Protection such as rules and lists.

## Deeper purchase and account protection fraud analytics and reporting

Fraud Protection will provide curated data sets, metrics, and Power BI reports for purchase protection and account protection. 

- The score rule optimizer, fraud tracker, rule monitor, and monthly business review reports for purchase protection will enable you to analyze historical transaction data, perform operational tasks, and make informed operational decisions. For example, you'll have access to data to help you make decisions pertaining to the score threshold, rejection of risky transactions, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing fraud trends and performance, and conducting deep dive analysis with a lens on purchase fraud. 

- The threat vulnerability analyzer and threat vulnerability trend reports for account protection will enable you to analyze account protection session data, investigate threat and fraud attacks at the session level, and make informed operational decisions. For example, you'll have richer insights pertaining to setting the score threshold, segmenting threat traffic, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing abusive traffic patterns, and validating machine learning score performance. The interactive tool will provide intelligence on various dimensions including geolocation, device configuration, IP, and reason code. The report from the tool will refresh every 24 hours with the latest account protection sessions and will retain account login and account creation sessions from the previous four weeks. The threat vulnerability trend report retains account login and account creation metrics and data from the previous four months.
