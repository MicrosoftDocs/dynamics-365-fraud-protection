# Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection mobile reference implementation

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides device fingerprinting that (i)
is based on artificial intelligence (AI); (ii) runs on Microsoft Azure; and
(iii) is cloud-scalable, reliable, and has enterprise-grade security. Fraud
Protection's device fingerprinting feature enables the identification of devices
(computer, Xbox, tablet, and so on) across multiple sessions or interactions
that engage with your business and other businesses in the Fraud Protection
fraud network. Additionally, this feature allows Fraud Protection to link
seemingly unrelated events to each other in the fraud network to identify
patterns of fraud.

When you implement Fraud Protection device fingerprinting by integrating the
reference implementation provided in your application, you (i) agree to
[Microsoft APIs Terms of Use](/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use), and
(ii) you direct Microsoft to process the following types of data from the
devices interacting with the Fraud Protection services (collectively, "Device
Fingerprinting Data"):

1.  Device attributes such as device ID, screen information, processor class,
    etc.

1.  Operating system (OS) attributes, such as OS information, OS version, OEM
    details, etc.

1.  Browser related attributes if applicable such as browser language, installed
    default apps, etc.

It is your responsibility to:

1.  Receive consent from your users to collect and allow Microsoft to process
    the Device Fingerprinting Data.

1.  Inform your customers of your data collection and processing practices, for
    example by disclosing the data you collect and how it is used.

1.  Disclose your use of third parties working on your behalf to process the
    data you collect, including Fraud Protection service providers.

1.  Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of Fraud
    Protection, including data protection laws.

In order to integrate the device fingerprinting for Fraud Protection, you will
need to complete the following tasks:

1.  Set up Microsoft Azure DNS by following the steps included under "Set-up
    Azure DNS" in [Set up device fingerprinting](device-fingerprinting.md).

1.  Integrate device fingerprinting with your mobile application using the
    reference implementation provided.

## Attribute category introduction reference


Below is a list of the device fingerprinting data that we may process and the
rationale for processing such data. Each of the data attributes described in the
list below is optional and you are free to configure the number of attributes
that best reflect the needs of your organization in relation to the privacy
rights of device users in your corresponding jurisdiction.

Attributes are categorized as follows and each attribute is identified with one
of the below mentioned categories.

- **Core Features:** This group of attributes are core to Fraud Protection's
ability to predict patterns of fraud. Based on our prior experience we have
every reason to believe that these attributes will be highly accretive to Fraud
Protection's model performance and ability to discern distinctive patterns of
fraud. If these are not supplied then the device fingerprinting will be
inaccurate.

- **Investigative Features:** This group of attributes have the potential to add
or enhance Fraud Protection's ability to predict patterns of fraud more
accurately. Statistical analysis of collected data is the only definitive way of
determining whether these attributes are strong predictors of patterns of fraud.
If the predictive capability of these attributes do not live up to our
expectations, then we will no longer utilize these attributes. While these group
of attributes would allow us to determine whether they will be strong predictors
of patterns of fraud, they are of course optional and are not required to be
provided.

- **Potential Label:** This group of attributes are utilized for model supervision
and labeling purposes. Each of these attributes by itself have a probability of
not providing ground truth. However, combining these attributes increases the
likelihood that the label used in training the Fraud Protection's model becomes
ground truth and hence results in higher model performance. Although Fraud
Protection can function without these attributes, the machine learning model
will be unable to improve without such attributes.

## Android technical reference


1.  Download Android reference implementation [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138490).

1.  Import the library module to your project (the library source becomes part of your project):

    1.  Select **File \> New \> Import Module**.

    1.  Enter the location of the library module directory, then select **Finish**.

The library module is copied to your project, so you can edit the library code.

1.  Make sure the library is listed at the top of your settings.gradle file, as
    shown here for a library named " :DynamicsFP". `include ':Demo', ':DynamicsFP'`

1.  Open the app module's build.gradle file and add a new line to the dependencies block as shown in the following snippet: `dependencies { implementation project(":DynamicsFP") } `

1.  Select **Sync Project with Gradle Files**.

1.  You can initiate reference implementation by calling the following process: 

```plaintext
import com.microsoft.dynamicsfp.androidsdk.DynamicsFP;

*DynamicsFP.start(getApplicationContext(), \$tenantId);*

\$tenantId :Provided by Microsoft(GUID/UUID)
```

You can initiate reference implementation code on base application class so it
can start collecting device attributes. Reference implementation does not prompt
Runtime Permission.

1.  You can send collected device attributes to Fraud Protetion by calling Fraud Protetion in the
    following way:

import com.microsoft.dynamicsfp.androidsdk.DynamicsFP;

```plaintext
*DynamicsFP.send(\$pageId);*

\$pageId(Optional): SI=SignIn, SU=SignUp, P= Purchase
```

You can call send() in any fragment/activity before or on the page that has the
operation you need a risk assessment for. For a sign in/sign up scenario, you can call
send() immediate after start() in base application class.

1.  Once you need sessionId, get it by calling:`*String sessionId = DynamicsFP.getSessionId();*` . SessionId is required when calling the risk assessment APIs.

### Android Runtime permissions

Reference implementations rely on the following runtime permissions to collect
various device data. Reference implementation does not request any runtime
permissions, the app should obtain the runtime permissions from the user.

-   android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

-   android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE

-   android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT

A different value is returned for apps on the same device that come from different vendors, and for apps on different devices regardless of vendor.Normally, the vendor is determined by data provided by the App Store. If the app was not installed from the app store (such as enterprise apps and apps still in development), then a vendor identifier is calculated based on the app's bundle ID. The bundle ID is assumed to be in reverse-DNS format. | Core Features          |

## iOS technical reference


1.  Download iOS Reference Implementation from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139005).

1.  Unzip the downloaded file and add all the files to your iOS app project. 

You can initiate Reference Implementation by calling: 

```plaintext
DynamicsFP.start(instanceId: \$tenantId) 

\$tenantId: Provided by Microsoft (GUID/UUID) 
```

You can initiate reference implementation on AppDelegate class so it can start
collecting device attributes on app startup. Reference implementation does prompt
location permission. 

You can send collected device attributes to Fraud Protection by calling: 

```plaintext
DynamicsFP.send(pageId: \$pageId) 

\$pageId(Optional): SI=SignIn, SU=SignUp, P=Purchase 
```

You can call send() in any UIViewController before or on the page that has the
operation you need a risk assessment for. For sign in/sign up scenarios, you can
call send() immediate after start() in AppDelegate class. 

Once you need sessionId, get it by calling: `**var** sessionId = DynamicsFP.getSessionId() `  
 
SessionId is required when calling the risk assessment APIs. 

**iOS runtime permissions:**

-   Reference implementation uses CLLocationManager and checks for
    CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedAlways or
    CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedWhenInUse before requesting **location**
    data. The app should obtain CLLocationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization or
    CLLocationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization permission from the user.

-   Reference implementation uses AppTrackingTransparency and checks for
    ATTrackingManager.AuthorizationStatus.authorized before collecting
    **AdvertisingId**. The app should obtain
    ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization permission from the user.
