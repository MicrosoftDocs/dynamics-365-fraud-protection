# Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection mobile reference implementation

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides device fingerprinting that is based on artificial intelligence (AI), runs on Microsoft Azure, and is cloud-scalable, reliable, and has enterprise-grade security. Fraud Protection's device fingerprinting feature enables the identification of devices (for example, a computer, Xbox, tablet, etc.) across multiple sessions or interactions, and that engage with your business and other businesses in the Fraud Protection fraud network. Additionally, the device fingerprinting functionality allows Fraud Protection to link seemingly unrelated events to each other in the fraud network to identify patterns of fraud.

When you implement Fraud Protection device fingerprinting by integrating the reference implementation provided in your app, you agree to [Microsoft APIs Terms of Use](/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use), and you direct Microsoft to process the following types of data from the devices interacting with the Fraud Protection services (collectively, "Device Fingerprinting Data"):

-  Device attributes such as device ID, screen information, processor class,
    etc.

-  Operating system (OS) attributes, such as OS information, OS version, OEM
    details, etc.

-  Browser-related attributes, if applicable, such as browser language, installed
    default apps, etc.

It is your responsibility to:

-  Receive consent from your users to collect and allow Microsoft to process
    the device fingerprinting data.

-  Inform your customers of your data collection and processing practices, for
    example by disclosing the data you collect and how it is used.

-  Disclose your use of third parties working on your behalf to process the
    data you collect, including Fraud Protection service providers.

-  Comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of Fraud
    Protection, including data protection laws.

To integrate device fingerprinting for Fraud Protection, you need to complete the following tasks:

1.  Set up Microsoft Azure DNS by following the steps under "Set-up Azure DNS" in [Set up device fingerprinting](device-fingerprinting.md).

1.  Integrate device fingerprinting with your mobile application using the reference implementation provided.


## Attribute category introduction reference

This section includes a list of the device fingerprinting data that we may process and the rationale for processing the data. Each of the data attributes described in the list below is optional. You can configure the number of attributes that best reflect the needs of your organization in relation to the privacy rights of device users in your corresponding jurisdiction.

Attributes are categorized as follows. Each attribute is identified with one of the categories below.

- **Core Features:** This group of attributes are core to Fraud Protection's ability to predict patterns of fraud. Based on prior experience, Microsoft has reason to believe that these attributes will be highly accretive to Fraud Protection's model performance and ability to discern distinctive patterns of fraud. If these core features are not supplied, device fingerprinting will be inaccurate.

- **Investigative Features:** This group of attributes have the potential to add or enhance Fraud Protection's ability to predict patterns of fraud more accurately. Statistical analysis of collected data is the only definitive way to determine whether these attributes are strong predictors of patterns of fraud. If the predictive capability of these attributes do not meet microsoft's expectations, then we will no longer utilize these attributes. While these group of attributes would allow Microsoft to determine whether they will be strong predictors of patterns of fraud, they are optional and are not required.

- **Potential Label:** This group of attributes are used for model supervision and labeling purposes. Each of these attributes on their own has a probability of not providing ground truth. However, combining the attributes increases the likelihood that the label used in training the Fraud Protection's model becomes ground truth and will therefore result in higher model performance. Although Fraud Protection can function without these attributes, the machine learning model will be unable to improve without them.

## Android technical reference


1.  Download the [Android reference implementation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138490).

1.  Import the library module to your project. The library source becomes part of your project.

    1.  SelectÂ **File \> New \> Import Module**.

    1.  Enter the location of the library module directory, then selectÂ **Finish**.

The library module is copied to your project. You can edit the library code.

1.  Make sure the library is listed at the top of yourÂ settings.gradleÂ file, as shown here for a library named " :DynamicsFP". `include ':Demo', ':DynamicsFP'`

1.  Open the app module's build.gradle file and add a new line to the dependencies block as shown in the following snippet: `dependencies { implementation project(":DynamicsFP") } `

1.  SelectÂ **Sync Project with Gradle Files**.

You can initiate reference implementation by calling the following process: 

```plaintext
import com.microsoft.dynamicsfp.androidsdk.DynamicsFP;

*DynamicsFP.start(getApplicationContext(), \$tenantId);*

\$tenantId :Provided by Microsoft(GUID/UUID)
```

You can initiate reference implementation code on base application class so it can start collecting device attributes. Reference implementation does not prompt the user for runtime permission.

You can send collected device attributes to Fraud Protection by calling Fraud Protection in the following way:


```plaintext
import com.microsoft.dynamicsfp.androidsdk.DynamicsFP;

*DynamicsFP.send(\$pageId);*

\$pageId(Optional): SI=SignIn, SU=SignUp, P= Purchase
```

You can call send() in any fragment/activity before or on the page that has the operation you need a risk assessment for. For a sign in/sign up scenario, you can call
send() immediate after start() in base application class.

Once you need sessionId, get it by calling:`*String sessionId = DynamicsFP.getSessionId();*` . SessionId is required when calling the risk assessment APIs.

### Android runtime permissions

Reference implementations rely on the following runtime permissions to collect various device data. Reference implementation does not request any runtime
permissions from the user, the app should obtain the runtime permissions from the user.

-   android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

-   android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE

-   android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT

## iOS technical reference


1.  Download the [iOS reference implementation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2139005).

1.  Unzip the downloaded file and add all of the files to your iOS app project.Â 
 
1. You can initiateÂ the reference implementationÂ by calling:Â 

```plaintext
DynamicsFP.start(instanceId:Â \$tenantId)Â 

\$tenantId:Â Provided byÂ Microsoft (GUID/UUID)Â 
```

You can initiate reference implementation onÂ AppDelegateÂ class so it can start collecting deviceÂ attributes onÂ app startup. Reference implementation doesÂ prompt for location permission.Â 

You can send collected device attributes to Fraud Protection by calling:Â 

```plaintext
DynamicsFP.send(pageId:Â \$pageId)Â 

\$pageId(Optional): SI=SignIn, SU=SignUp, P=PurchaseÂ 
```

You can callÂ send() in anyÂ UIViewControllerÂ before or on the page that has the  operation you need a risk assessment for. For sign in/sign up scenarios, you can callÂ send() immediate after start() inÂ AppDelegateÂ class.Â 

Once you needÂ the sessionId,Â get it by calling: `**var**Â sessionIdÂ =Â DynamicsFP.getSessionId()Â `  
Â 
SessionIdÂ is required when calling the risk assessment APIs.Â 

### iOS runtime permissions

-   Reference implementation uses CLLocationManager and checks for CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedAlways or CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedWhenInUse before requesting **location** data. The app should obtain CLLocationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization or CLLocationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization permission from the user.

-   Reference implementation uses AppTrackingTransparency and checks for ATTrackingManager.AuthorizationStatus.authorized before collecting **AdvertisingId**. The app should obtain ATTrackingManager.requestTrackingAuthorization permission from the user.
