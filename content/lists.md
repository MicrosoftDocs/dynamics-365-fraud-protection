# Manage lists for Fraud Protection

## Overview

Lists help you manage information that you use to fight fraud and enforce business policies. For example, you can create a list to track payment instruments that you consider risky or user email addresses that you consider safe. You can then upload the list as a comma-separated values (CSV) file and then reference it in a [rule](rules.md) to help automate decisions.

The **Lists** page has a separate tab for each of the two types of list that you can create: **Custom lists** and **Support lists**.


### Custom lists

Custom lists are created and defined by you. You can upload any number of custom lists and fill them with data that is specific to your business needs or your fraud protection strategy. For example, you can create a custom list that contains email addresses, IP addresses, or product IDs, and additional values that are associated with each entry.

### Support lists

Support lists are system-defined lists of email addresses and payment instruments that have a status of **safe**, **block**, or **watch**. For each entry, the list includes an associated expiration date. Although support lists can be viewed and downloaded from the **Lists** page, they can be modified only through the [Support page](risk-support.md).

### Format requirements

To upload a custom list in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, you must first create and save the list as a CSV file on your local computer. The file must meet the following requirements:

- It must be in CSV UTF-8 (comma-delimited) format (\*.csv).
- It must contain a unique header for every column.
- The file size must be less than 20 megabytes (MB).

## Use lists

[Rules](rules.md) define custom logic that automates business decisions. To help define this logic, you can take advantage of any list in a rule. For example, you can create one list of email addresses that you consider risky and another list of email addresses that you consider safe. You can then configure a rule so that all sign-in attempts that use an email address in the **Risky Emails** list are rejected, whereas sign-in attempts that use an email address in the **Safe Emails** list are approved.

### Single-column and multicolumn lists

The following example shows two separate lists, **Risky Emails** and **Safe Emails**. In both lists, a single column of values represents a key (in this case, the email address).

| Risky Emails |
|--------------|
| `Kayla@contoso.com` |
| `Jamie@bellowscollege.com` |
| `Marie@atatum.com` |

| Safe Emails |
|-------------|
| `Camille@fabrikam.com` |
| `Miguel@proseware.com` |
| `Tyler@contoso.com` |

However, you can use additional columns to hold values that are relevant to the key. For example, instead of using two separate lists, you can combine the same information into one multicolumn list, as shown here.

| Email address | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| `Kayla@contoso.com` | Risky |
| `Jamie@bellowscollege.com` | Risky |
| `Marie@atatum.com` | Risky |
| `Camille@fabrikam.com` | Safe |
| `Miguel@proseware.com` | Safe |
| `Tyler@contoso.com` | Safe |

You can then configure your rule so that all sign-in attempts that use an email address that appears in this list and has a status of *Risky* are rejected, whereas attempts that use an email address that has a status of *Safe* are approved.

In addition to using multicolumn lists to combine safe and block lists, you can use them to specify the unique levels of risk that are associated with a set of products, email addresses, or countries/regions. For example, if specific product types present different levels of risk to your business, you can make decisions for those products differently. Specifically, you can evaluate each product against its own score threshold. To use this approach, you must first create a list that represents this information, as shown in the following example.

| Product type | Score threshold |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Digital | 500 |
| Consumable | 600 |
| Physical | 750 |

You can then configure a rule that enforces the rejection of transactions where the [risk score](ap-scorecard.md#risk-model-score) exceeds the specified threshold for the product type. For information about how to create effective rules to customize your business logic, see [Rules](rules.md).

## Upload a list

You can upload organized data in a list file to Fraud Protection and then reference the list in a [rule](rules.md). The file must adhere to the specifications that are described in the [Format requirements](lists.md#format-requirements) section earlier in this topic.

To upload a list to Fraud Protection, follow these steps.

1. Select **New list**.
1. Select **Browse** to find the file. Select the file, and then select **Open**.

    Fraud Protection opens a preview of the file for you to review. The preview pane shows a maximum of 20 rows.

1. To upload the file, select **Continue**. To upload a different file, select **Cancel**, and then repeat step 2.
1. Add a name and description that will make it easy for your team to identify and use the list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The list name can't be changed after you complete this step.

1. Select **Create**.

    Because of caching, it might take up to two minutes for the list to become active.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't include the following sensitive personal data or highly regulated data types in the files that you upload:
>
> - Biometric data, genetic data, or any data that is related to health
> - Personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, or religious views
> - Personal data that, by its nature, is sensitive or private, such as data about a person's sexual orientation or philosophical beliefs
>
> For information about how data is used and protected in Fraud Protection, see [Security, compliance, and data subject requests](security-compliance.md).

## Update a list

You can update a custom list from the **Lists** page at any time, to add new information or change existing information. You can change the description of a custom list, but you can't change its name.

To modify support lists, use the [Support page](risk-support.md).

To update the contents of a custom list in Fraud Protection, follow these steps.

1. If the most up-to-date version of the list is already saved on your computer, open that file. Otherwise, you must first select the list that you want to update, and then select **Download** to get the most up-to-date version.
1. Make all your edits directly in the file. When you've finished, save the file to your computer.
1. On the **Lists** management page, select the list to update, and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **Browse** to find the file. Select the file that you just edited, and then select **Open**.

    Fraud Protection opens a preview of the file for you to review. The preview pane shows a maximum of 20 rows.

1. To upload the file, select **Continue**, and then select **Update**. 

    Because of caching, it might take up to two minutes for the list to become active.

To update the description of a custom list in Fraud Protection, follow these steps.

1. Select the list to update, and then select **Edit**.
1. Update the text in the **Description** field, and then select **Update**.

## Delete a list
