ms.custom:

This article provides visual abstract representation and description of how Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection – Account Protection interacts with our customers to support their users. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection provides merchants the capability to assess if the risk of attempts to create new accounts and attempts to log in on merchant’s ecosystem are fraudulent. Risk assessment in Fraud Protection can be used by the customer to block or challenge suspicious attempts to create new fake accounts or to compromise existing accounts. The diagram below highlights some of the product capabilities and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to help you better understand these interactions. Particularly for Account Create and Account Login scenarios.
