# Lists overview

Lists help you manage information that you use to fight fraud and enforce business policies. For example, you can create a list to track payment instruments that you consider risky or user email addresses that you consider safe. You can then upload the list as a comma-separated values (CSV) file and then reference it in a [rule](rules.md) to help automate decisions. 

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, there are two types of list that you can create, custom lists and support lists.
