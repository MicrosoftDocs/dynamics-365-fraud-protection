# Notifications for Fraud Protection service

Microsoft regularly sends communications regarding service incidents, service changes, maintenance, releases, and other required actions related to your use of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection (Fraud Protection) service. These communications are posted to the Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard and the Message center.

## Message center

The [Microsoft 365 Message center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/message-center?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) displays maintenance notifications, service changes, release information, and customer action requests.

## Service Health Dashboard

The [Service Health Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/view-service-health) displays the latest status of updates and incidents regarding your service. For information on how to access the Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard, see [How do I check my online service health?](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/check-online-service-health)

Additionally, you can configure your email preferences to receive messages posted on the Message Center and Service Health Dashboard by e-mail. For information on how to set this up, see [Message center Preferences](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center?view=o365-worldwide#preferences&preserve-view=true).
