## Security assessment FAQ

### Authentication and administration

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Does the application or service support single sign-on (SSO) through Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 1.1, SAML 2.0, or Web Services Federation (WS-Fed)? | Yes.<ul><li><strong>Portal:</strong> SPA - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, with implicit flow</li><li><strong>Service-to-service back-end API:</strong> OAuth 2.0</li><li><strong>Fingerprinting Service:</strong> Anonymous</li><li><strong>Azure Stack:</strong> Shared access signature (SAS) token for storage</li></ul> |
| Does the application support Okta integration (SSO platform)? | This integration isn't supported by default. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports custom integrations. Because the merchant owns the tenant, the merchant can take advantage of Azure AD identity integration points. For more information, see the [Azure AD documentation](/azure/active-directory/). |
| Is there a "back-door" URL that lets users or administrators bypass SSO? | No. |
| Does the application or service support two-factor authentication (2FA)? | Yes. The merchant can enable 2FA in Azure AD. |
| Describe the 2FA solution. | 2FA is an Azure AD feature. For more information, see [How it works: Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks). |
| Does the application support application-level passwords? | No. User and application identities are managed in the customer's Azure AD. |
| Which hash or encryption algorithm is used to protect passwords? | Not applicable. |
| Is hash salting used? | Not applicable. |
| Does the application or service use automatic account provisioning? How is it accomplished (for example, on-demand via SAML, automated comma-separated values (CSV) feed over secure transmission, or API)? Provide documentation. | No, and not applicable. |
| Does the application or service use immediate account access termination, including closing open sessions? | No. Azure AD token expiration aligns user access termination, not the session. |
| If account terminations aren't automatic, is this action performed within one hour of an account access termination request? | Yes, per Azure AD policy. |
| Document the process. All actions must be logged. | For more information, see the [Azure AD documentation](/azure/active-directory/). |
| What is the session idle time-out of the application? | Per Azure AD policy, the session idle time-out is in line with the token validity period. |
| Does the application or service use an automatic account deprovisioning process via an API? | No. |
| Does the application or service provide a disposition strategy for content that is attached to a user's account upon deprovisioning? | No. Only audit logs are tracked and retained as features per Online Services Terms (OST) guidelines and the Microsoft Privacy Statement. |
| Does the application or service let the administrator explicitly grant authorization to data and capabilities based on role and/or function, according to the least privilege model? | Yes. Via Azure AD roles, administrators can grant access within their tenant. |
| A minimum expectation is support for the Administrator role, User role, Read-Only Administrator (log) role, and unprivileged Administrator (no access to content) role. Do you provide this support? | The application/service doesn't have any roles besides the admin role. Users in the Administrator role are responsible for spinning out additional roles within their tenant. For information about how to add and remove roles, see [Configure user access to Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection](configure-user-access.md). |
| If there are sharing permissions in the application, does the application or service let the administrator review user requests for additional access to data? | Not applicable. |
| Does the application or service let the administrator user distinguish "administrator users" and "regular users"? | No. |
| Document the rights that are available for the various roles in the application or service. Examples include read-only accounts and the log audit role. | For more information, see the Fraud Protection onboarding guide. |

### Auditing

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Does the application or service log information in an industry-standard type of event format, such as CSV, Common Event Format (CEF), or Syslog? | Log data isn't shared by the product. Service metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) are surfaced via Power BI views. |
| Does the application or service collect or provide data about user sign-in, sign-out, password changes, and failed sign-in attempts? | Yes. For more information, see [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs). |
| Does the application or service collect or provide audit logs of administrator actions (user account Create/Update/Delete) or application-specific actions? | <p>The application maintains an audit history of key changes, such as rule or list updates. User account actions and corresponding audit history are controlled via Azure AD. For more information, see the overview in [Azure Active Directory reports and monitoring documentation](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/index) and [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs).</p><p>For Azure AD auditing, see the core directory events for application role and group membership in [List of Azure Active Directory Audit Activities](/archive/blogs/motiba/list-of-azure-active-directory-audit-activities).</p><p>For access to audits from the Azure AD portal, see [Audit activity reports in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs).</p> |
| Does the application or service collect or provide audit logs of user actions (document or content Create/Read/Update/Delete)? | Not applicable. Only the admin role is supported. |
| Does the application or service collect or provide audit logs of metadata actions (Create/Read/Update/Delete)? | Yes. An audit history of key changes, such as list and rule updates, is maintained. |
| Can Microsoft provide audit trails for any activities that are performed on personally identifiable information (PII)? | The only PII is in the audit history of rule and list changes. This history is read-only and can't be modified. |
| Can Microsoft store logs and encrypted data at rest? | Logs are maintained per standard Microsoft Azure Online Services policy. |
| Does Microsoft have procedures in place to detect, report, and alert about the downtime of the customer instance within a reasonable time frame if the instance is down? | Yes, we have advanced monitoring and alerting capabilities in place. |
| What information is provided to customers to validate the negotiated service level agreement (SLA)? | As a customer, you can make a server-to-server call to the service and monitor the SLA directly. |
| How is this notification reported to customers? | No proactive downtime notification is in place. It's currently part of the roadmap. Customers are notified about any incidents that are discovered via alerting through the standard communications channel. |

### Business continuity and disaster recovery

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Does the application or service enable unstructured data to be exported in bulk in a non-proprietary format, such as CSV? | In the product, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) experience lets users export data under the guidelines that are described in the section about data subject rights in the [Compliance documentation](./security-compliance.md). |
| Does the unstructured data retain security access control lists (ACLs)? | No. For more information, see the GDPR documentation that is listed in [Honor data subject requests](./security-compliance.md#honor-data-subject-requests). |
| Does the application or service enable databases to be exported in bulk in a non-proprietary format? | No. |
