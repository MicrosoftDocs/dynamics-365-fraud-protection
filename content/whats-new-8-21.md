# What's new in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection October 2021 release

[!include [preview banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

The following features are included in the October, 2021 release of Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection, payment service provider (PSP) enablement and  deeper fraud analytics and reporting for purchase and account protection scenarios.

## Payment service provider (PSP) protection

The October, 2021 release provides new capabilities to enhance PSPs ability to offer Fraud Protection as a value-added fraud protection service to their merchants.

PSPs can integrate Fraud Protection into their existing infrastructure to manage PSP taxonomies that encompass many merchants and multiple hierarchies within each merchant entity. Other PSP-focused scenarios are supported, including: managing the creation and addition of multiple merchants; observing and managing merchant fraud performance across a single merchant, multiple merchants, and across PSP verticals using artificial intelligence; and the use of rules and lists.

## Purchase and account protection fraud analytics and reporting

Fraud Protection provides curated data sets, metrics, and Microsoft Power BI reports for purchase protection and account protection. 

- The score rule optimizer, fraud tracker, rule monitor, and monthly business review reports for purchase protection enable you to analyze historical transaction data, perform operational tasks, and make informed operational decisions. For example, you have access to data to help you make decisions pertaining to the score threshold, rejection of risky transactions, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing fraud trends and performance, and conducting deep dive analysis with a lens on purchase fraud. 

- The threat vulnerability analyzer and threat vulnerability trend reports for account protection enable you to analyze account protection session data, investigate threat and fraud attacks at the session level, and make informed operational decisions. For example, with the October, 2021 release, you have richer insights pertaining to setting the score threshold, segmenting threat traffic, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing abusive traffic patterns, and validating machine learning score performance. The interactive threat vumnerability tool provides intelligence on various dimensions including geolocation, device configuration, IP, and reason code. The report from the tool refreshes every 24 hours with the latest account protection sessions, and will retain account login and account creation sessions from the previous four weeks. The threat vulnerability trend report retains account login and account creation metrics and data from the previous four months.
