# Swagger UI
Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code.

[Swagger UI](https://dfpswagger.azurewebsites.net/index.html) for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection offers a web-based UI that provides information about the Fraud Protection service, using the generated OpenAPI specification. 

For more information about Swagger UI, see the [Swagger UI home page](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).
