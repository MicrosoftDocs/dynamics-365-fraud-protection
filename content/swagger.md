# Swagger UI
Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code.

[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) offers a web-based UI that provides information about a service, using the generated OpenAPI specification. 

View the [Swagger UI documentation for Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection](https://dfpswagger.azurewebsites.net/index.html) to learn about Fraud Protection APIs.
