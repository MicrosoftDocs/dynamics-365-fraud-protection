# Threat vulnerability analyzer tool



The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection threat vulnerability analyzer tool lets you analyze account protection session data, and investigate threat and fraud attacks at the session level. It also helps you make informed operational decisions, such as setting the score threshold, segmenting threat traffic, estimating score threshold impact, analyzing abusive traffic patterns, and validating the performance of machine learning (ML) scores. The interactive tool provides intelligence about various dimensions, such as geolocation, device configuration, IP address, and reason code.

The threat vulnerability analyzer is an interactive report tool that is built on the Power BI platform. You can use it to analyze threat vulnerability for account protection in your online systems by applying various filters, changing the score threshold, and viewing an analysis of historical trends.

The threat vulnerability analyzer report is updated with the latest account protection sessions every 24 hours. The time stamp on the report shows the update time in Coordinated Universal Time. The threat vulnerability analyzer retains account sign-in and account creation sessions from the past four weeks. It's limited to four million sign-in sessions. Reports might show blank results because of insufficient data.

The threat vulnerability analyzer includes the following report tabs:

- **Summary** – This report shows key metrics, distributions, and trends at a high level.
- **Hourly Heat Map** – This report shows the hourly distribution of volume, average bot score, and risk score. It can help you identify seasonality and anomalies.
- **Week Over Week** – This report compares the selected date and the remaining days of that week to previous weeks. It helps you determine whether a weekly pattern holds, and can help you identify trends and fraud patterns.
- **Day Over Day** – This report compares the selected date and the previous six days. It helps you determine whether a daily pattern holds, and can help you identify trends and fraud patterns.
- **Location Distribution** – This report compares the volume distribution and relative volume for the selected location to the total traffic at the country/region, state/province, or city level.
- **Score Distribution** – This report shows the bot and risk score distribution and cumulative percentage. It can help you optimize the score threshold and estimate impact.
- **Reason Code** – This report slices the traffic by bot and risk model reason code. It can help you understand the most significant factors that the model provides.
- **Status** – This report shows the score distribution by session status and status changes over time. You can use it to validate the efficacy of the score against a given session status.
- **Label** – This report shows the score distribution by label state and label changes over time. You can use it to validate the efficacy of the score against a given label state.
- **Device Configuration** – This report shows the traffic distribution by device configuration properties, such as operating system and browser.
- **IP Deep Dive** – This report provides a deep-dive analysis of IP addresses that have a high volume. It also identifies trends for IP addresses at a selected percentile.
- **Device ID Level** – This report provides a deep-dive analysis of device IDs that have many shared users. It also identifies risky devices at a selected percentile.
- **Session details** – This report enables drill-through from any report, so that you can view session details such as device and location data. You can apply filters to segment sessions for a deep-dive investigation.

## Summary

You can configure the filter and granularity options on the top of the **Summary** tab. 

The **Summary** report shows high-level metrics, such as volume, percentage that has no geolocation, average bot score, and average risk score.

The **Summary** report includes the following charts:
