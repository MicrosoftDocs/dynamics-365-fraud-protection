# What's new in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection April 2022 release

[!include [banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]


Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection brings together account protection, payment protection, and loss prevention, providing a 360-degree view of the fraud landscape to partners and businesses to help them discover and combat fraud efficiently and effectively.

We have invested in six areas in this release to amplify our partners' and businesses' ability to fight fraud: 

  

## Payment service providers (PSPs), cloud service providers, system integrators, and other fraud solution providers that manage fraud on behalf of other businesses can now use Fraud Protection to more effectively and efficiently operate and manage their customers at scale

Fraud solution providers such as PSPs that offer fraud management services to run and operate on behalf of many businesses are now able to:

- More effectively manage fraud across many businesses, where each business has its own hierarchy of tenants and multiple verticals.

- Use aggregated fraud analytics to observe what is happening across all their customer businesses.

- Benefit from enhanced policy creation and management across all their customers.

## Enable search capabilities to enhance the analytics and policy setting for fraud managers

Fraud Protection is introducing a new search capability that can help fraud managers run fraud operations more efficiently. Complementary to the existing fraud analytics in purchase protection and account protection, the new search feature extends a fraud manager's ability to find information. Fraud managers can find transaction events that include historical and relationship context and discover clusters of unusual behavior and previously unknown interconnections across transaction events.

## Natively integrated case management for purchase protection

Fraud Protection previously offered an optional plug-in for manual review that product owners could choose to use to build, host, and connect to their Fraud Protection instance. With this new feature, case management for purchase protection is natively integrated into Fraud Protection. Using the Fraud Protection rules experience, fraud managers can identify purchase transactions that require further review and add them to the manual review queue. They can then take the appropriate action on these transactions from within Fraud Protection.

## Canadian provisioning

Businesses are now able choose to provision Fraud Protection within Canada, the United States, or Europe. Businesses with data residency needs specific to Canada or with tight latency needs are able to choose a region within Canada to provision to.

## Protect native mobile applications against fraud

Fraud managers are now able to protect their native mobile applications in addition to their mobile browser-based applications. Mobile protection is available for both purchase protection and account protection.

## Protect Power Apps portal products against fraud

Fraud Protection now provides both a certified purchase protection Power Apps portals connector and a certified account protection Power Apps portals connector that enable businesses to easily integrate products built using Power Apps portals with Fraud Protection. With this feature, businesses can better protect their customers from fraud.
