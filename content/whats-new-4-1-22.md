# What's new in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection April 2022 release

[!include [banner](includes/preview-banner.md)]

The April 2022 release of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection introduces several new capabilities and enhancements.

In this release, we have invested in six areas to help improve the ability of our partners and businesses to fight fraud.

## Manage customers at scale

Payment service providers (PSPs), cloud service providers, system integrators, and other fraud solution providers that manage fraud on behalf of other businesses can now use Fraud Protection to more effectively and efficiently operate and manage their customers at scale.

Fraud solution providers such as PSPs that offer fraud management services that run and operate on behalf of many businesses can now:

- More effectively manage fraud across many businesses, each of which has its own hierarchy of tenants and multiple verticals.
- Use aggregated fraud analytics to observe what is happening across all their customer businesses.
- Benefit from enhanced policy creation and management across all their customers.

## Enable search capabilities to enhance analytics and policy settings

Fraud Protection is introducing a new search capability that can help fraud managers run fraud operations more efficiently. The new search feature complements the existing fraud analytics in purchase protection and account protection, and extends a fraud manager's ability to find information. Fraud managers can find transaction events that include historical and relationship context, and can discover clusters of unusual behavior and previously unknown interconnections across transaction events.

## Natively integrated case management for purchase protection

Fraud Protection previously offered an optional plug-in for manual review that product owners could use to build, host, and connect to their Fraud Protection instance. In the new feature, case management for purchase protection is natively integrated into Fraud Protection. Fraud managers can use the Fraud Protection rules experience to identify purchase transactions that require further review and add them to the manual review queue. They can then take the appropriate action on those transactions in Fraud Protection.

## Provisioning in Canada

Businesses can now provision Fraud Protection in Canada, the United States, or Europe. Businesses that have data residency requirements that are specific to Canada, or that have tight latency requirements, can select a region in Canada to provision to.

## Protect native mobile applications

Fraud managers can now protect their native mobile applications in addition to their mobile browser-based applications. Mobile protection is available for both purchase protection and account protection.

## Protect Power Apps portal products

Fraud Protection now provides both a certified purchase protection Power Apps portals connector and a certified account protection Power Apps portals connector. These connectors enable businesses to easily integrate products that are built by using Power Apps portals with Fraud Protection. This feature helps businesses better protect their customers from fraud.
