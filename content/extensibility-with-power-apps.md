# Work with Power Apps

Microsoft Power Apps offer a low-code, drag-and-drop, formula-based web tool that you can use to intuitively create full applications (mobile or desktop). These apps can be useful for the more interactive and complex processes that your organization might want to develop by using eventing data from Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection.

## Getting started

The following resources will help you start to develop your own apps by using Power Apps:

- [Free App in a Day PowerApps training and more from Pragmatic Works](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/free-app-in-a-day-powerapps-training-and-more-from-pragmatic-works/) â€“ Power Apps training videos, and a full curriculum that takes you through the whole process of building an app that uses data from Common Data Service.
- [Official Power Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/)

## Sample app

[Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection Portal Admin App](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-Fraud-Protection-Samples/tree/master/power%20app%20sample) is integrated with event tracing data from Fraud Protection and with Common Data Service. It serves as an administrative toolbox application for the Fraud Protection portal. The app is fully open-source, and can be modified or used just as a reference.
