# Account protection schemas for historical data

This topic outlines the schemas for historical data that is uploaded in bulk into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection as comma-separated values (CSV) files. If data will be ingested via the application programming interface (API), see [Integrate Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection real-time APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fraud-protection/integrate-real-time-api).

Note the following formatting guidelines throughout:

- The files are in CSV UTF-8 (comma-delimited) format (\*.csv).
- The maximum file size is 10 gigabytes (GB).
- The **DateTime** columns are in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8601 format. For example, **DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o")** might have the result **2019-03-14T20:18:11.254Z**.
- The decimal precision is two decimal places.
- The following characters are escaped in all columns: commas, new line characters, and multiline characters.
