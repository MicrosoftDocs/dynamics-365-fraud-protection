# Data schemas for loss prevention

This topic outlines the schemas that define the data that is used to generate models and determine risk assessments.

Note the following formatting guidelines throughout:

- The files are in CSV UTF-8 (comma-delimited) format (\*.csv).
- The maximum file size is 10 gigabytes (GB).
- The **DateTime** columns are in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 8601 format. For example, **DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o")** might have the result **"2019-03-14T20:18:11.254Z"**.
- The decimal precision is two decimal places.
- The following characters are escaped in all columns: commas, new line characters, and multiline characters.
- Any field that has a "NOT NULL" constraint is **mandatory**. All other fields are **optional**.
