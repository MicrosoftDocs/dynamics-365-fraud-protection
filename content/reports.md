# Loss prevention reports

[!include[deprecation](includes/deprecation.md)]

The loss prevention feature in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection identifies anomalies and patterns that might indicate in-store fraud. Adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) is used to analyze historical data and identify patterns of anomalies in it. Reports are then generated as the output of this analysis. Store managers and fraud investigators can use the reports to focus on anomalous entities that, according to the risk scores that the AI models generate, might indicate fraud. The detailed reports provide trend analysis, based on the return rate, the discount rate, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
